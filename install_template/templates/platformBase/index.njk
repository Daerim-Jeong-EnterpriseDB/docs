{% block prereqverbiage %}SEEMS LIKE YOU NEED A MACRO-TYPE STRUCTURE FOR navigation SECTION OF FRONT MATTER.
IF PPC, THEN YOU GET ONE NAV STRUCTURE. IF X86 THEN YOU GET ANOTHER. 

SIMILARLY YOU NEED TO INSERT A VALUE INTO HEADING ("IBM Power" or "x86") BASED ON ARCHITECTURE

For operating system-specific install instructions, including instructions for accessing the repo, see:

- [RHEL 8](PRODUCT_KEY_rhel8_ARCHITECTURE)


{{ "IBM Power" if platform.arch === ppc64le else "x86" }}


{% if platform.arch["ppc64le"] %}
{% else %}
  x86
{% endif %}

{% endblock prereqverbiage %}

FOR EACH LINK, WE NEED A WAY TO INSERT PRODUCT KEY AND ARCHITECTURE VALUE.  
WE ALSO NEED A DIFFERENT SET OF LINKS BASED ON ARCHITECTURE
