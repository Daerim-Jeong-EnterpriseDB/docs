## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```
{% block prodprereq %}{% endblock prodprereq %}

- Set up the repository

    - Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step. If you do need to set up the repository, you must register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

    - To set up the respository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the screen instructions.

    - The script available from the repository includes the install command. If you need additional information about running the install command or initial configuration, refer back to this topic.
