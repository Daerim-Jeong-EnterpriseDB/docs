  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step. 

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the screen instructions.

  Instructions for installing the package are also available from the repository. If you need additional information about running the install command or initial configuration, refer back to this topic.
