## On Linux 

To install EDB Wait States on a Linux system:

1.  Enter the following command:

  ```shell
  sudo <package-manager> -y install <install-command>
  ```

  Where: 
  
    - `<package-manager>`is the package manager used with your operating system:

      | Package manager | Operating system     |
      | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
      | dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
      | yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
      | zypper          | SLES                             |
      | apt-get         | Debian and derivatives           |

    - `<install-command>` is the command required for the type of Postgres distribution you're using. In these commands `<version>` is the version of the Postgres distribution. 

      | Type of Postgres distribution | Install command                             |
      | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
      | PostgreSQL                    | postgresql`<version>`-edb_wait_states       |
      | EDB Postgres Advanced Server  | edb-as`<version>`-edb_wait_states           |
      | EDB Postgres Extended Server  | edb-postgresextended`<version>`-wait-states |
 
   
  For example, to install EDB Wait States for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 16 on a RHEL 9 platform:

  ```shell
  sudo dnf -y install edb-as16-edb_wait-states
  ```
  
1. To launch the worker, register it in the `postgresql.conf` file using the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter. For example:

  ```ini
  shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/edb_wait_states'
  ```

1.  Restart the database server. After a successful restart, the background worker begins collecting data.

1. To review the data, create the following extension:

  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION edb_wait_states;
  ```

1. To terminate the EDB Wait States worker, remove `$libdir/edb_wait_states` from the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter, and restart the database server.


## On Windows

To install EDB Wait States on a Windows system:

1.  To install the EDB Wait States module with the `EDB Modules` installer, invoke the StackBuilder Plus utility. Follow the onscreen instructions to finish installing the `EDB Modules`.

1. To register the worker, modify the `postgresql.conf` file to include the EDB Wait States library in the `shared_preload_libraries` configuration parameter. The parameter value must include:

  ```ini
  shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/edb_wait_states.dll'
  ```

  The EDB Wait States installation places the `edb_wait_states.dll` library file in the following path:

  ```text
  C:\Program Files\edb\as14\lib\
  ```

1. Restart the database server to make the changes take effect. After a successful restart, the background worker starts and begins collecting the data.

1. To view the data, create the following extension:

   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION edb_wait_states;
   ```

The installer places the `edb_wait_states.control` file in the following path:

```text
C:\Program Files\edb\as14\share\extension
```

## Uninstalling

To uninstall EDB Wait States:

1.  Use the `DROP EXTENSION` command to drop the `edb_wait_states` extension. 
1.  Modify the `postgresql.conf` file, removing `$libdir/edb_wait_states.dll` from the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter. 
1.  To apply your changes, restart the database server.
