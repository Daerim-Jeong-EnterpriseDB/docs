EDB is committed to a security first approach, from the products we build and the platforms we operate, to the services we provide our customers. Transparency is a core principle for the program and part of this effort includes welcoming incoming reports so that we can address concerns surfaced by our customers or security researchers. Youâ€™ll also find it in our advisories, which detail issues found and the required fixes or mitigations needed to keep your data and databases safe.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) logs unredacted passwords prior to 14.6.0
<br/></summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em> EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) versions before 14.6.0 log unredacted passwords in situations where optional parameters are used with CREATE/ALTER USER/GROUP/ROLE, and redacting was configured with edb_filter_log.redact_password_commands. The fixed versions are 10.23.33, 11.18.29, 12.13.17, 13.9.13, and 14.6.0.

Updated: 2022/01/01<br/>
EDB supplied PostgreSQL inherits ACL for installation directory
<br/></summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em> A vulnerability was found in PostgreSQL versions 11.x prior to 11.3. The Windows installer for EDB-supplied PostgreSQL does not lock down the ACL of the binary installation directory or the ACL of the data directory; it keeps the inherited ACL. In the default configuration, this allows a local attacker to read arbitrary data directory files, essentially bypassing database-imposed read access limitations. In plausible non-default configurations, an attacker having both an unprivileged Windows account and an unprivileged PostgreSQL account can cause the PostgreSQL service account to execute arbitrary code.

EDB Advanced Server 8.2 improperly handles debugging function calls
<br/></summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em> EDB Postgres Advanced Server 8.2 does not properly handle certain debugging function calls that occur before a call to <code>pldbg_create_listener</code>, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a SELECT statement that invokes a <code>pldbg_</code> function, as demonstrated by (1) <code>pldbg_get_stack</code> and (2) <code>pldbg_abort_target</code>, which triggers use of an uninitialized pointer.
