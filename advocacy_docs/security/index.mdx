Updated: 05/02/2023<br/>
Multiple versions of EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) are affected by a high severity vulnerability
<br/></summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em> EDB/EnterpriseDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) before 14.6.0 logs unredacted passwords in situations where optional parameters are used with CREATE/ALTER USER/GROUP/ROLE, and redacting was configured with edb_filter_log.redact_password_commands. The fixed versions are 10.23.33, 11.18.29, 12.13.17, 13.9.13, and 14.6.0.

Updated: 01/01/2022<br/>
Multiple Postgresql versions are affected by a high severity vulnerability
<br/></summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em> A vulnerability was found in PostgreSQL versions 11.x prior to 11.3. The Windows installer for EnterpriseDB-supplied PostgreSQL does not lock down the ACL of the binary installation directory or the ACL of the data directory; it keeps the inherited ACL. In the default configuration, this allows a local attacker to read arbitrary data directory files, essentially bypassing database-imposed read access limitations. In plausible non-default configurations, an attacker having both an unprivileged Windows account and an unprivileged PostgreSQL account can cause the PostgreSQL service account to execute arbitrary code.

Updated: 10/15/2018<br/>
EnterpriseDB Postgres Advanced Server version 8.2 is affected by an unscored vulnerability<br/></summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em> EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 8.2 does not properly handle certain debugging function calls that occur before a call to <code>pldbg_create_listener</code>, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a SELECT statement that invokes a <code>pldbg_</code> function, as demonstrated by (1) <code>pldbg_get_stack</code> and (2) <code>pldbg_abort_target</code>, which triggers use of an uninitialized pointer.
