!!! Note 
The exploit referred to in this CVE did not work on PostgreSQL 16. The
same defensive code as other releases has been added in PostgreSQL 16.2, EPAS
16.2 and PGE 16.2 to ensure strength in depth. We strongly recommend upgrading
your PostgreSQL 16, EPAS 16 and PGE 16 deployments to these versions.
