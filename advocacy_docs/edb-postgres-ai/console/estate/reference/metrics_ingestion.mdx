description: The metrics that can be ingested into the EDB Postgres AI Estate.
---

All agents in the EDB Postgres AI Estate can send metrics to the Estate control plane.

Currently the following metrics are ingested into the Estate control plane:

* Database size (derived from pg_database_size()) and presented in MiB
* Recovery status (derived from pg_is_in_recovery())
* Postgres version (derived from version())

The metrics ingestion process is secure and doesn't collect any data from the tables themselves.
