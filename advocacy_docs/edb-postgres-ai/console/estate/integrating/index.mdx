description: How to integrate resources into the EDB Postgres AI Estate so they appear as part of the EDB Postgres AI Console's single pane of glass.
---

There are three ways to integrate resources into the EDB Postgres AI Estate.

* Automatically using the [EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service](../../../cloud-service/). Clusters created or managed there automatically deliver metrics to the Estate, and appear in the Estate's single pane of glass. Users can also opt for schema ingestion which brings in metadata from the database.
* Directly, by configuring the Estate to gather resource metrics from a source.
* Indirectly, by using the [EDB Postgres AI Agent](../../agent/).

## Automatic integration

When you use the EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service to create or manage clusters, the Estate automatically gathers metrics from those clusters. Selecting **Schema Ingestion** during cluster creation also brings in metadata from the database. Details of this process are available in the [Schema Ingestion](integrate_schema) section.


## Direct integration

You can configure EDB Postgres AI's Estate to gather resource metrics directly from a source. One example of this is the Estate's [AWS integration](integrate_aws), which, once configured allows you to see the information about your AWS resources in the EDB Postgres AI Console.
