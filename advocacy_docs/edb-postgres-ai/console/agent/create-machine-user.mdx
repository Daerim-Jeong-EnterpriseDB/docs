1. In the EDB Postgres AI Console, using your avatar's dropdown, select the **User Management** page.

2. Select the **Add New User** button.

3. On the **Add New User** page, select *Machine User*, give the user a name, check the **Create Access Key** checkbox, give the key a name, and finally, select the **Add User** button.

4. After you get your access key, store it somewhere securely, as EDB does only lets you view access keys at creation time. If you lose your record of an access key, you will have to get a new/replacement key by regenerating it.

5. Next, go to the project from which you want to monitor the database, select the **Users** tab, and locate the machine user you just created.

6. Select the edit button to the right of the user entry, then select the **Assign Roles** button.

7. In the **Assign Project Roles** modal, select the "estate ingester" option and then select the **Submit** button.

8. Your machine user is ready for estate ingestions from Beacon Agent.
