EDB Postgres Distributed is a high availability solution for EDB Postgres databases. PGD provides a distributed database environment designed to ensure high availability and fault tolerance for mission-critical workloads. PGD works with EPAS, PGE, or PostgreSQL databases. 

PGD is available for self-managed deployment and on the [EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service](../cloud-service) (as the Distributed High Availability option).
