NetBackup provides a nondisruptive way of validating your resiliency plan for assurance and compliance through automated recovery and rehearsal of business-critical applications. Moving data and spinning up applications when and where you need to without risking data loss requires business-level resiliency. Veritas NetBackup for PostgreSQL Agent extends the capabilities of NetBackup to include backup and restore of PostgreSQL databases. If a NetBackup environment is operational within an organization, then users can back up and restore EDB Postgres Advanced Server and EDB Postgres Extended Server with the help of Veritas NetBackup for PostgreSQL Agent.
