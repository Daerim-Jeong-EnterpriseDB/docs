CyberArk Central Policy Manager (CPM), automatically enforces enterprise policy. This password management component can change passwords automatically on remote machines including those in  EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL databases and store the new passwords in the Enterprise Password Vault ( EPV), with no human intervention, according to the organizational policy. It also enables organizations to verify passwords on remote machines, and reconcile them when necessary.  Storing the passwords in the EPV then allows you to benefit from all accessibility and security features of the EPV.

In addition to tracking user credentials quickly and efficiently, CyberArk prevents those credentials from being lost or corrupted. By stripping away unnecessary complexities associated with monitoring, CyberArk helps businesses avoid many of the most common data breach scenarios that start with compromised credentials.

CyberArk supports EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL databases to store and manage passwords, which helps to secure data against cybersecurity attacks, malware, and hacking threats.
