After you configure your Kubernetes environment, you can start taking backups and completing restores.

## Launch a backup

1. Launch your Kasten K10 interface.

2. Use Kasten K10 to launch a backup that creates two restore points: a local and a remote.

3. You now have a backup to use to validate a restore.

## Backup process summary
    
The Kasten by Veeam backup process is:
1. EDB elects a replica for the backup.
2. Kasten discovers the replica.
3. Kasten calls the EDB pre-backup command on the discovered replica.
4. The replica becomes ready for the backup.
5. Kasten takes the backup.
6. Kasten calls the EDB post-backup command on the replica.
7. The replica leaves the backup mode.
8. The backup is over and is consistent for a restore.

## Restore database

1. To get ready for Kasten K10 to complete a restore, remove the EDB namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete ns edb
```

2. In the Kasten K10 interface, go to your remote restore point.

3. On the remote restore point, select **restore**.

4. After the restore is complete, all of your data is present.
