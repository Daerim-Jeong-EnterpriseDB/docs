Kasten by Veeam is a data management platform built for Kubernetes that can provide enterprise operations teams with an easy-to-use and secure system for backup and restore of Kubernetes applications. Kasten can be used with EDB Postgres for Kubernetes and the EDB external backup adapter to successfully back up and restore data.

The EDB Postgres for Kubernetes [external backup adapter](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/addons/#external-backup-adapter) allows for a third-party tool, such as Kasten by Veeam, to discover an API that's needed to create a successful backup.
