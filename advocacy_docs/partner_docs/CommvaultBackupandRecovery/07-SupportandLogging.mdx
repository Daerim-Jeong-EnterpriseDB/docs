## Support

Technical support for the use of these products is provided by both EDB and Commvault.  A proper support contract is required to be in place at both EDB and Commvault.  A support ticket can be opened on either side to start the process.  If it is determined through the support ticket that resources from the other vendor is required, the customer should open a support ticket with that vendor through normal support channels.  This will allow both companies to work together to help the customer as needed.

## Logging

**EDB Postgres Advanced Server Logs:**

Navigate to the `Data` directory in your chosen EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance and from here you can navigate to `log`, `current_logfiles` or you can navigate to the `postgresql.conf` file where you can customize logging options or enable `edb_audit` logs.

**EDB Postgres Extended Server Logs**

Navigate to the `Data` directory in your chosen EDB Postgres Extended Server instance and from here you can navigate to `log`, or you can navigate to the `postgresql.conf` file where you can customize logging options.  An example of the full path to view EDB Postgres Extended logs: `/var/lib/edb-pge/15/data/log`.

**PostgreSQL Server Logs**

The default log directories for PostgreSQL logs vary depending on the operating system:

- Debian-based system: `/var/log/postgresql/postgresql-x.x.main.log. X.x.`

- Red Hat-based system: `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_log`

- Windows: `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.3\data\pg_log`

** Commvault Logs**

Commvault logs can be found a few ways.  A first way is within the Content Store directory/folder in the Commvault folder on your system.  For example if on a Windows system the Log File path would be `C:\Program Files\Commvault\ContentStore\LogFiles` where you can then see all of the differnt types of logs Commvault collects.  

You can also gather some job specific logs within the Commvault interface.

1. Open Commvault Backup & Recovery's Command Center and from the navigation pane, go to `Jobs > Job History`.

2. Find the specific job you would like to view logs for and click on the `...` beside that job.

3. Select `View Logs`.
