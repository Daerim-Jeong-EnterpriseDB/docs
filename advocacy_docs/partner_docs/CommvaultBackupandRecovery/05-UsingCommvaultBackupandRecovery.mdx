You can back up and restore an EDB database using Commvault Backup & Recovery.

## Using Commvault Backup & Recovery

Commvault provides two methods of taking the backup from an EDB database and restoring it:

-  DumpBasedBackupSet backup and restore
-  FSBasedBackupSet backup and restore

!!! Note
    At this time there is a known issue with FSBased Incremental/PITR Restore that does not allow for proper restoration of the database. See the known issues section of the guide for more information. 

## DumpBasedBackupSet Backup and Restore

Dump-based backup uses the pg_dump utility to take the backup.

#### Taking DumpBasedBackupSet backup 

1. Open the Commvault Backup & Recovery's Command Center. From the navigation pane, select **Protect > Databases**.

2. Select the required instance.

3. In the **Backup sets** section, select **DumpBasedBackupSet**.

   ![Instances Page](Images/Dumpbackup2.png)

4. In the **Database groups** section, select the database group that you want to back up. In this case it's **default**.

5. In the **Backup** section, select **Back up now**.

   ![Backup Section](Images/Dumpbackup4.png)

6. in the Select Backup Level screen, select **Full**.

   A job is created to take the backup.

8. When the backup job is complete, its status changes to Completed.

#### Restoring DumpBasedBackupSet backup 

You can use DumpBasedBackupSet to restore the individual databases.

1. From the navigation pane, select **Protect > Databases**.
2. Select the instance that you want to restore.
3. In the **Recovery points** calendar, select **DumpBasedBackupSet**.

   ![Recovery Points Calendar](Images/Dumprestore1.png)

4. Select a date from the calendar, and then select **Restore**.
5. The Backup Content screen displays the databases to restore. Select the required database to restore or select all of them to restore all.

6. Select **Restore**.
7. From the **Restore Options** screen, select the destination server and destination instance. Then select **Submit**.

   A job is created to restore the backup.

8. When the Restore has completed successfully, log in to the EDB database and check that the restore operation recovered the data. This example connected to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance:

## FSBasedBackupSet Backup and Restore
A file system backup backs up data that resides on a Windows or UNIX computer.

### Taking FSBasedBackupSet Backup
1. Open Commvault Backup & Recovery's Command Center and from the navigation pane, go to `Protect > Databases`.

2. Click on the required instance.

3. In the `Backup sets` section, click on `FSBasedBackupSet` backup set.

4. In the `Database groups` section, click the database group that you want to back up. In this case it is `default`.

5. In the `Backup` section, click `Back up`.

6. Choose between a Full or Incremental backup in the `Select Backup Level` screen, this example chose an incremental backup.

   ![Select FSBased Backup Type](Images/SelectFSBasedBackupType.png)

7. A job will be created to take the backup, which you can view by clicking on the `Job ID` for that backup.

   ![FSBased Backup Job](Images/FSBasedBackupJob.png)

8. When the job is complete, the information about the job can be found on the job's page.

   ![FSBased Backup Job Details](Images/FSBasedBackupJobDetails.png)

#### Restoring FSBasedBackupSet Full Backup
Backed up data can be restored for a subclient or an entire backup set with either an in-place restore, out-of-place restore or for a Linux file server to a standalone file server.

1. Ensure that your EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance is stopped

2. Delete or rename the WAL directory and data directory.

3. From the navigation pane, go to `Protect > Databases`.

4. Click the instance you want to restore.

5. In the `Recovery Points` calender, select `FSBasedBackupSet`.

6. Select a date where a full FSBasedBackupSet was taken and click `Restore`.

7. The `Backup Content` screen will display the databases to be restored, select the required database to restore or select all of them to restore all.

   ![FSBased Backup Restore Databases](Images/FSBasedFullRestoreDatabases.png)

8. Click `Restore`.

9. From the `Restore Options` screen, select where you want the restore to complete, in-place, out-of-place or restore to disk for a Linux server.

   ![FSBased Backup Restore Details](Images/FSBasedFullRestoreOptions.png)

10. Select the `Destination Server` and `Destination Instance` and click on submit.

11. A Job will be created to restore the backup.

12. When the Restore has completed successfully Commvault will automatically start the server using the pg_ctl utility.

13. You can check that the server was started successfully with a command like, `"C:\Program Files\edb\as15\bin\pg_ctl" -U enterprisedb status -D "C:\Program Files\edb\as15\data"` and it should return a message that the server is running.

```bash
C:\Program Files\edb\as15>"C:\Program Files\edb\as15\bin\pg_ctl" -U enterprisedb status -D "C:\Program Files\edb\as15\data"
pg_ctl: server is running (PID: 20896)
C:/Program Files/edb/as15/bin/edb-postgres.exe "-D" "C:\Program Files\edb\as15\data"
```

14. If you would like the server to be controlled by a Services utility you will need to stop it with the pg_ctl utility and start it again in your Services utility, for example Services(Local) in Windows or systemctl in UNIX.

15. After you have started the service with your utility of choice, login to your EDB database and check that the restore operation recovered the data.

## Known Issues
FSBaseBackupSet Incremental or Point-In-Time(PITR) Restore has issues with Postgres and EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions 13 and onward.  The behavior is due to a change that was made in Postgres version 13. From the release notes, `Generate an error if recovery does not reach the specified recovery target`.  While Commvault does provide a time target for the recovery, the recovery is performed entirely by Postgres and Postgres does not know how to reach that time target, therefore it fails.  This can happen where there are no transactions between backup jobs.  A workaround for this solution is to always introduce a transaction scenario, such as a create and drop database, before doing a log backup.  Another workaround is to use `recovery_target_lsn` in the postgresql.conf file instead of uisng `recovery_target_time`.  Commvault is aware of this error on their side and is working on how to mitigate from their end.
