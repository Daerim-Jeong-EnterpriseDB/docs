You can back up and restore an EDB database using Commvault Backup & Recovery.

## Using Commvault Backup & Recovery

Commvault provides two methods of taking the backup from an EDB database and restoring it:

-  DumpBasedBackupSet backup and restore
-  FSBasedBackupSet backup and restore

!!! Note
    At this time there's a known issue with FSBased Restore that doesn't allow for proper restoration of the database. See [Known issues](#known-issues) for more information. 

## DumpBasedBackupSet Backup and Restore

Dump-based backup uses the pg_dump utility to take the backup.

#### Taking DumpBasedBackupSet backup 

1. Open the Commvault Backup & Recovery's Command Center. From the navigation pane, select **Protect > Databases**.

2. Select the required instance.

3. In the **Backup sets** section, select **DumpBasedBackupSet**.

4. In the **Database groups** section, select the database group that you want to back up. In this case it's **default**.

5. In the **Backup** section, select **Back up now**.

6. in the Select Backup Level screen, select **Full**.

   A job is created to take the backup.

8. When the backup job is complete, its status changes to Completed.

#### Restoring DumpBasedBackupSet backup 

You can use DumpBasedBackupSet to restore the individual databases.

1. From the navigation pane, select **Protect > Databases**.
2. Select the instance that you want to restore.
3. In the **Recovery points** calendar, select **DumpBasedBackupSet**.

4. Select a date from the calendar, and then select **Restore**.
5. The Backup Content screen displays the databases to restore. Select the required database to restore or select all of them to restore all.

6. Select **Restore**.
7. From the **Restore Options** screen, select the destination server and destination instance. Then select **Submit**.

8. When the Restore has completed successfully, log in to the EDB database and check that the restore operation recovered the data. This example connected to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance:

## FSBasedBackupSet Backup and Restore
A file system backup backs up data that resides on a Windows or UNIX computer.

### Taking FSBasedBackupSet Backup
1. Open Commvault Backup & Recovery's Command Center and from the navigation pane, go to `Protect > Databases`.

2. Click on the required instance.

3. In the `Backup sets` section, click on `FSBasedBackupSet` backup set.

4. In the `Database groups` section, click the database group that you want to back up. In this case it is `default`.

5. In the `Backup` section, click `Back up`.

6. Choose between a Full or Incremental backup in the `Select Backup Level` screen, this example chose an incremental backup.

   ![Select FSBased Backup Type](Images/SelectFSBasedBackupType.png)

7. A job will be created to take the backup, which you can view by clicking on the `Job ID` for that backup.

   ![FSBased Backup Job](Images/FSBasedBackupJob.png)

8. When the job is complete, the information about the job can be found on the job's page.

#### Restoring FSBasedBackupSet Full Backup
Backed up data can be restored for a subclient or an entire backup set with either an in-place restore, out-of-place restore or for a Linux file server to a standalone file server.

1. From the navigation pane, go to `Protect > Databases`.

2. Click the instance you want to restore.

3. In the `Recovery Points` calender, select `FSBasedBackupSet`.

4. Select a date where a full FSBasedBackupSet was taken and click `Restore`.

5. The `Backup Content` screen will display the databases to be restored, select the required database to restore or select all of them to restore all.

6. Click `Restore`.

7. From the `Restore Options` screen, select where you want the restore to take go, in-place, out-of-place or restore to disk for a Linux server.

8. Select the `Destination Server` and `Destination Instance` and click on submit.

9.

## Known Issues
FSBaseBackupSet Restore has an issue if the default edb directory (for example, `*:\Program files\edb`) has been lost or deleted. If this occurs then after a restore is performed, the permissions on the restored directories are not recovered. Instead the directory inherits the permissions from the parent directory which does not allow EDB Postgres Advanced Server services to start on the restored directory. We are working with Commvault to resolve the issue.
