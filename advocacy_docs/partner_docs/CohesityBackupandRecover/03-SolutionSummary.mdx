Using the Cohesity Connector Agent, you can backup and restore EDB Postgres Advanced Server databases, as well as set specific backup policies for your databases and keep track of the backup and restore runs. Cohesity’s backup and recovery tool provides peace of mind for database owners with its nontraditional approaches to backups.  Cohesity Platform natively integrates with PostgreSQL to provide backup and recovery for PostgreSQL deployments. Cohesity’s Datasource Connector Agents allow for flexibility of customization, including being supported on Helios, which is Cohesity’s data management platform.

Cohesity Platform provides a PostgreSQL connector that enables you to perform a full backup, incremental (differential) backup, log backup, restore and point in time restore at the cluster level.

The following are the core components for protecting EDB Postgres Advanced Server databases:

- EDB Postgres Advanced Server
- Cohesity Backup Appliance
- Cohesity PostgreSQL connector
- Cohesity Connector Agent


The diagram below shows how you can integrate the Cohesity Platform with your EDB Postgres Advanced Server deployments using the Cohesity PostgreSQL connector and Connector Agent.
