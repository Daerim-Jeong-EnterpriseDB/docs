When you have configured your Kubernetes environment per the Configuring section you will then be able to start taking backups and completing restores.

## Create a Backup Policy with the EDB hooks

In the `Configuring` section, you installed the EDB Blueprint with the edb-hooks.yaml file.  You will now be able to create a backup policy with those hooks.

1. Create a policy for the EDB namespace, you will need to set up a location profile for the export and kanister actions.

Add the hooks example:
    ![Kasten Backup Policy with EDB Hooks](Images/KastenBackupPolicywithHooks.png)

## Launch a Backup

1. Using Veeam Kasten K10 launch a backup that creates two restore points, a local and a remote.

!!! Note
    The Veeam backup process is explained below:
    1. EDB elects a replica for the backup.
    . Kasten will discover the replica.
    3. Kasten calls the EDB pre-backup command on the discovered replica.
    4. The replica becomes ready for the backup.
    5. Kasten takes the backup.
    6. Kasten calls the EDB post backup command on the replica.
    7. The replica leaves the backup mode.
    8. The backup is then over and is consistent for a restore.

2. Delete the namespace `EDB`.

```bash
kubectl delete ns edb
```

## Restore Database

1. Go to your remote restore point.

2. On the remote restore point select `restore`.

3. After you have restored all of your data should be present.
