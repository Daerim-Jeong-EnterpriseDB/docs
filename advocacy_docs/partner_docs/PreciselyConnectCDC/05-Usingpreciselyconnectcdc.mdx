![Mappings of Tables](Images/tablemappings.png)

14. Open Distributions —> Newly Created Distribution —> Requests —> New Request —> Copy. Copy will copy/replicate all the data in tables from EDB Postgres Advanced Server Source Instance to  EDB Postgres Advanced Server Target Instance.

15. Provide required information and click Ok on Copy Request Properties Screen.

![Copy Request](Images/copyrequest.png)

## Save the Model

The Model created in the above steps needs to be saved, validated and committed before the Replication can be performed.

1. To save the Model, click File and select Save option and provide the name for the Model.

2. Right Click Enterprise Data Movement Model and select Validate to validate the Model.

3. No error will be displayed if the Model is valid.

![Model Validation](Images/validmodel.png)

4. Right Click Enterprise Data Movement Model and select  Commit —> Full.

![Model Commit](Images/modelcommit.png)

5. Click Ok on Commit Model Screen. This will create the Model files.

## Execute Copy Replication using Connect CDC MonCon

Connect CDC MonCon is a GUI application, separate from the Connect CDC Director, that you use for monitoring and control functions. We will use Connect CDC MonCon to execute the Copy Replication. Copy Replication will copy all the data from the Source Tables to the Target Tables.

1. Open Connect CDC MonCon.

2. Click Model —> New Model from Menu.

3. Provide Hostname/IP and select the saved Model from the drop down list.

![New Model](Images/newmodel.png)

4. In the Request Section, select the Distribution Model that was created for copying data created in the above steps and right click and select start.

![Distribution Model](Images/distributionmodel.png)

5. Click on Process to see the progress.

![Process](Images/Process.png)

6. Open pgAdmin once the copy operation is completed successfully and connect the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Target Instance and check the tables and the data is copied to the tables.

![pgAdmin](Images/pgAdmincopydone.png)

![pgAdmin](Images/pgAdmincopydone2.png)

## Create Replication Distribution using Connect CDC Director

Once the Copy replication operation is successful then a Replication option will be executed which will replicate all the changes made on the Source Tables to the Target Tables.

1. Open Connect CDC Director.

2. Create the Replication Request from Distributions —> Newly Created Distribution —> Requests —> New Request —> Replication.

3. Enter the name and press Ok.

![Replication Request](Images/replicationrequest.png)

![Replication Request](Images/replicationrequest2.png)

4. Save the changes in the Model.

5. Right Click Enterprise Data Movement Model and select Validate to validate the Model.

6. Right Click Enterprise Data Movement Model and select  Commit —> Full.

7. Click Ok on Commit Model Screen. This will create the Model files.

## Execute Replication option using Connect CDC MonCon

Replication distribution will replicate all the changes done on the Source Tables to the Target Tables.

1. Open Connect CDC MonCon.

2. As the Model is updated in the Connect CDC Director to add the Replication Distribution, click on the Model Update, this will add the Replication Distribution to the Connect CDC MonCon Interface.

3. The replication request will be displayed once the Model is updated successfully.

![Replication Request](Images/replicationrequest3.png)

4. In the Request Section, select the Distribution Model created for Replication and right click and select Start.

![Distribution Model](Images/distrmodel.png)

5. On the Source Instance, update the data to be replicated in the Source Tables.

6. On the Target Instance, check data in the Target Tables, data will be updated there.

## Data Transformation

Precisely Connect CDC has options that let you modify the source data you are distributing or even create or derive the data you distribute. You can use predefined functions to accomplish these data transformations or you can construct your own operations or functions.

For example, to express source currency values in terms of a different currency, you specify the transformation algorithm to use for that column mapping. For some common transformations, the algorithm is supplied as a predefined Connect CDC function.

The algorithms you specify are known in the Connect CDC Director as expressions. The Connect CDC Expression Handler parses them and then creates runtime code that calculates the result for the expressions.

In addition to or instead of calls to predefined functions, expressions may have an arbitrary number of constants, column references, and calculations on those constants and columns and functions. Their results must be compatible in type and length with the target column.

The following steps demonstrate data transformations.

1. Open Connect CDC Director.

2. Go to Source DBMS Server —> Tables —> Sending Tables.

3. Select the table(s) to perform data transformation using the checking box in front of them and right click and select Properties —> Mappings.

4. On the Mapping tab, you define the column mappings for each of your target tables with respect to the source tables. The Mapping tab displays the corresponding columns in the Target Column and Source Data columns in each row. Connect CDC Director automatically mapped target columns to source columns that have the same name.

When the Connect CDC Director maps a source table to a same-named target table, it also associates individual source table columns with same-named target table columns. You then select which of these column pairings you want to include in your data distribution, which additional column pairings you want to arrange, and what type of data transformation, if any, you want to assign to each column pairing.

Mappings Tab has the following options

- Receiving server list : The name of the target server is displayed.
- Receiving table list : The name of the target table is displayed. If it does not (for example, because its name does not match your source table’s), select the target table from the Receiving table list. The list includes all tables in the list of Available tables for the target server. Any table name with [M]preceding it is already mapped to a source table.
    
The Mapping tab grid displays each target table column and its datatype as well as its default corresponding source column, if any. Copy column under Method in the grid means the source column value is to be distributed without any special handling or transformation.

- Target Column : Contains all the columns in the target table.
- Datatype : Datatype of the column for both Source and Target tables as per the mapping defined between source and target table.
- Source Data : Contains all the columns in the Source table.
- DKey : This column identifies the Distribution Key. By default, DKey is marked for the Primary key. You can deselect the default and add as many check marks as necessary.
- Method : It contains a list of data transformation functions.

5. In our example, click on Method drop down list for the target column loc and select lower case, this data transformation will convert the data in loc column of target table to lower case after the replication is done.

![Data Transformation](Images/datatransformation1.png)

6. Perform the replication from Connect CDC MonCon.

7. On the Target Instance, check data in the Target Table dept, data will be transformed for column loc and it will be stored as lower case.
