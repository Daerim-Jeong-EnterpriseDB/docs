## Prerequisites
Implementing Precisely Connect CDC with EDB Postgres Advanced Server requires the following components:

!!! Note
	The EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server and PostgreSQL Server products will be referred to as Postgres Distribution. The       	specific Distribution type will be dependent upon customer need or preference.


- Precisely supported source and target systems. The source, target or both can be your Postgres Distribution(s). In our example we will be using EDB   Postgres Advanced Server for both the source and target database.
- Precisely Connect CDC software.
- PostgreSQL management tool such as pgAdmin or Postgres Enterprise Manager. In our example we will use pgAdmin. This tool will be used to verify that the data is being replicated as expected.

## Configuring EDB Postgres Advanced Server

These components are needed before integrating EDB Postgres Advanced Server with Precisely Connect CDC:

1. 2 running instances of EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

2. pgAdmin must be installed on the Source and Target EDB Postgres Advanced Server instances.

To use the Precisely Connect CDC’s replication functionality, two running instances of EDB Postgres Advanced Server are required, one will act as the Source EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance where the data set will reside which will then be replicated to the Target EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance.

The following steps demonstrate how to enable WAL Archiving on the Source EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance, which is required for Precisely Connect CDC’s replication functionality.

1. Go to the installation directory of EDB Postgres Advanced Server (e.g `C:\Program Files\edb\as14\`).

2. Go to the data directory and open the postgresql.conf file.

3. Modify the following settings as per the given values.

```yaml
archive_mode = on
wal_level = logical
archive_command = 'copy "%p" "C:\\archive_wal_directory\\%f"'    
max_replication_slots = 20

```

4. Restart the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Source instance.

Please note that no configuration e.g WAL Archiving is required on Target EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance.
