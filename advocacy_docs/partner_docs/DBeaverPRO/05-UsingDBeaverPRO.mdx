After DBeaver PRO is connected to an instance of EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server, you can access the capabilities of DBeaver PRO.

!!! Note
    We refer to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server, and PostgreSQL as the Postgres distribution. The specific distribution type depends on your needs and preferences.

## Sample user scenarios

!!! Note
    The user scenarios shown are provided as example use cases of DBeaver PRO and EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server. They aren't intended to show all functionality.

### Connecting to the database

1. Launch DBeaver PRO.
2. Double-click the database connection you want to open.
3. Enter the username and password and select **OK**.

4. You are now connected to your database instance.

### Viewing tables and data

Using the appropriate SQL code, three tables (`AGENTS`, `CUSTOMERS`, and `ORDERS`) were created in the `edb` database, and data was inserted to help visualize some basic functionality.  

![Database Navigator for Viewing Tables and Data](Images/DBNavigate2.png)

1. In the Database Navigator, right-click your database. In this example that's **edb**.
2. Select **SQL Editor > Open SQL Console**. This opens a console where you can enter and run SQL code.

3. After the tables are created, double-click the table name to look at the properties. The figure shows the properties of the the `Customers` table.

4. Select the **Data** tab to view the data in the table.

5. Select the **ER Diagram** tab to view the Entity Relationships for the table.

## Using Schema Compare 
DBeaver has introduced a new feature that allows users to compare schemas, databases or tables with their Schema Compare function. A user can compare two schema/database structures and generate a report.  

See the DBeaver documentation for more details on how to enable the full functionality of this feature, along with it's requirements.

1. In the `Database Navigator` select the schema, database or table you want and right click it.

2. Navigate to `Compare/Migrate Schema` in the menu.

3. Select `Compare/Migrate Schema`.

4. When the Schema Compare window pops up, the `Source` will already be selected, as it's the schema/database/table you selected in the first steps.

5. Navigate to the `Target` and click the `down` arrow, in the `Select Data Source` window that pops up, select your database for your `target`.

6. Select through the `down` arrows in the `target` source until you get to the item you want to compare.  In our example we selected the `EnterpriseDB` schema for the source and the `public` schema for the target.

7. Click `Next`.

8. On the Schema Compare Settings page that appears ensure you have all of the objects that you want to be compared checked, and you can select the type of `report engine` per your needs.

9. Select 'Proceed`.

10. The `Results` window will then be generated and it is here you can compare your data and save a report.  In the case of our example, the schemas were the same so the results did not show difference.

You will most likely be comparing schemas that are not the same and the below image shows what the Schema Compare function can look like when comparing different schemas in a database.
