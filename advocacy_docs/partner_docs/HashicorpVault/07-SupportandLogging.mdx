## Support

Technical support for the use of these products is provided by both EDB and Hashicorp. A support contract is required to be in place at both EDB and Hashicorp. You can open a support ticket with either company to start the process. If it's determined through the support ticket that resources from the other vendor are required, open a support ticket with that vendor through normal support channels. This approach allows both companies to work together to help you as needed.

## Logging

The following logs are available.

### EDB Postgres Advanced Server logs

Navigate to the `Data` directory in your chosen EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance. From there, you can navigate to `log` or `current_logfiles`. Or, you can navigate to the `postgresql.conf` file where you can customize logging options or enable `edb_audit` logs.

### EDB Postgres Extended Server logs

Navigate to the `Data` directory in your chosen EDB Postgres Extended Server instance. From there, you can navigate to `log`, or you can navigate to the `postgresql.conf` file where you can customize logging options. An example of the full path to view EDB Postgres Extended Server logs is `/var/lib/edb-pge/15/data/log`.

### Hashicorp Vault logs

You can use the `journalctl` function to call logs for Hashicorp Vault.  

If you want to view only the Vault logs, you can do so by entering `journalctl -ex -u vault` at the command line.

If you want to view logs for a specific day and output those results to a `.txt` file, you can do so by entering `journalctl -u vault -S today > vaultlog.txt` at the command line. Adjust the date as needed and the text title.
