Hashicorp Vault is an identity-based secrets and encryption management system. Used with EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions 15.2 and later or EDB Postgres Extended Server versions 15.2 and later, it allows you to control access to encryption keys and certificates and perform key management. Using Hashicorp Vault’s KMIP secrets engine allows Vault to act as a KMIP server provider and handle the lifecycle of KMIP-managed objects.

Hashicorp Vault’s KMIP secrets engine manages its own listener to service any KMIP requests that operate on KMIP-managed objects. The KMIP secrets engine determines the set of KMIP operations that the clients can perform based on roles they are assigned.
