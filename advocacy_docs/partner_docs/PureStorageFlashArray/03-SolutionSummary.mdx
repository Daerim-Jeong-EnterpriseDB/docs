Pure Storage FlashArray is an enterprise-ready, flash-storage solution that provides enterprise performance, reliability, and availability for your enterprise databases. FlashArray provides faster transactions by way of the protocols it deploys, even with big demands on applications. FlashArray runs exclusively on the nonvolatile memory express (NVMe) protocol for memory access and storage. FlashArray also uses high availability to allow for less downtime in your databases if a failure occurs.

Pure Storage provides you with enterprise-grade flash storage arrays to address storage needs. You can use these flash storage arrays with your EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server, or PostgreSQL Server databases for your data storage. FlashArray//X is a performance-optimized, all-flash storage array that provides block storage for Tier 0 and Tier 1 applications. FlashArray//C is capacity-optimized, all-flash storage for Tier 2 applications.

The following image shows how Pure Storage Flash Array integrates with your hardware server and an EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server, or PostgreSQL Server to provide the servers with FlashArray storage capabilities.
