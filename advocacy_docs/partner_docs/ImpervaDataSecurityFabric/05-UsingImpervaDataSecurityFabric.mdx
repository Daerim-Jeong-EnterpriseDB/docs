This section features use cases that show how Imperva SecureSphere Agent will monitor an EDB Postgres Advanced Server Database.  There are many different options and reports that can be configured with the Imperva SecureSphere agent installed on your EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database.  Some of these are: scan and assess the servers, configure security policies, create and/or manage reports, configure and view audited traffic and configure or work with a Database Cluster.  For in depth information on the many pieces of Database Activity monitoring with the Imperva SecureSphere Agent follow the link: https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/v14.9-database-activity-monitoring-user-guide/page/70414.htm 

### Monitor EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL Database Traffic

Monitoring database traffic

## Set-up to Monitor Database Traffic

1. Install agent

2. Run the basic management configuration 

3. Connect to the Database using external client and run queries

4. Check that the traffic was intercepted and displayed in the management audit screen

Here is an example of a query to table name “my_test_table” and the DB is PostgreSQL. The table does not exist and therefore the SQL exception is marked as true.
