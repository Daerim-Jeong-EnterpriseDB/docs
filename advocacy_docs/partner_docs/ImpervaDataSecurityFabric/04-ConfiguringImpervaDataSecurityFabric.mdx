Implementing Imperva SecureSphere Agent with EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL requires the following components:
- Database Monitor Agent installed on same server with EDB Postgres Advanced Server  or PostgreSQL.  
- Database Security Gateway.
- Management server.

## Prerequisites

- Installing and configuring the SecureSphere Management.
- Register the Gateway to the Management server.
- Installing the SecureSphere Agent by running the installation file.
- Register the Securesphere Agent to the Gateway.

### Configure Imperva SecureSphere Agent for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 

## Basic SecureSphere Configuration Overview

The primary objective of basic configuration is to identify traffic you want to protect. This is accomplished by defining the basic building blocks that comprise the SecureSphere domain using a number of parameters including IP addresses, ports, protocols and more. The screen shot below illustrates basic configuration of these components.

There are several configuration steps that can be taken with the Imperva SecureSphere Agent in your environment as it is a highly configurable agent to provide custom protection and support for your EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL databases.  This guide will list some basic configuration methods, but for a more complete list of configuration, please see the Basic SecureSphere Configuration Doc at https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/v14.4-web-application-firewall-user-guide/page/427.htm

The basic components are configured in the following order:

1. **Sites**: Defines the primary container of all other objects. For information on creating and managing sites

2. **Server Groups**: Defines one or more servers at a specific location based on IP addresses. creating and managing server groups, see Basic Server Group Configuration.

3. **Services**: Define a service type hosted by a server group based on service. Represents a database service for example PostgreSQL Database. In sider a server group, there can be a number of services on different ports and
    various database types.

4. **Application**: An application represents one or more databases and schemas operating on a database service.For example, inside a single PostgreSQL database server installation, there may be two databases running. By assigning to different database applications, you can assign different policies to protect each database.
