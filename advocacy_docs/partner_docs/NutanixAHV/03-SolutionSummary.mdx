You can deploy EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server, EDB Failover Manager, Postgres Enterprise Manager, and Barman on virtual machines created using the native Nutanix hypervisor,
AHV, or VMWare ESXi. AHV represents a unique approach to virtualization that offers powerful capabilities needed
to deploy and manage enterprise applications. AHV complements the value of hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI)
by integrating native virtualization along with networking, infrastructure, and operations management in
a single intuitive interface: Nutanix Prism.

The following diagram shows a high-level architecture of the Nutanix platform.
