EDB provides MacOS installers for PostgreSQL at the [downloads page of the EnterpriseDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads). These installers simplify the process of setting up a system.

For a detailed walk-through of the installation process on Mac OS, see [this tutorial](https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/installation-postgresql-mac-os).

## Command line tools

After installing PostgreSQL, you can run command line tools by referencing them in the `bin` directory under the installation path you specified during installation. For example, to run `psql` from the default installation directory, enter:

```shell
/Library/PostgreSQL/12/bin/psql -U postgres
```

For ease of use, you may want to add this directory to your PATH by adding a line to your `~/.bash_profile` (or `~/.zshrc` if using zsh):

```shell
export PATH="/Library/PostgreSQL/12/bin/:$PATH"
```

This step is *especially* important if you plan to use scripts or other software (such as Python's `psycopg2`) that rely on PostgreSQL tools. You may instead [add this directory to the system path](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106355/setting-the-system-wide-path-environment-variable-in-mavericks/106814#106814).

There are several other options for installing PostgreSQL on MacOS, with varying levels of flexibility, version support, add-ons, and so forth. More details can be found on [the PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/).
