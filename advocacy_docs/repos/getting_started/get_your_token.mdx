description: How to get the token you need to download EDB software
---

To download EDB software, you need a token. This token is a string that identifies you and your eligibility to download software from EDB. If you have an account on EDB, your account will be associated with a token and we will show you how to retrieve it.

If you do not have an account, [sign up for a free EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/register). 
Signing up gives you a trial subscription to EDB's software repositories. 

## How to retrieve your token

Go to the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) page, where you can obtain your Repos 2.0 token. 
You may have to sign in to your EDB account to access this page. If you do sign in, you'll go to the account profile page. On the account profile page, select **Repo Access** to continue.

You sill now be on the EDB Repositories page.
On your first visit to this page, select **Request Access** to generate your Repos 2.0 token. Copy the token using the **Copy Token** icon, and store it safely.


Once you’ve created your EDB account and created your token, you’ll able to go to edbpostgres.com/downloads and download the software you need.
