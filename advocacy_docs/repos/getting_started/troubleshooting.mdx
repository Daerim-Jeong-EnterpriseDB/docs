description: How to troubleshoot your repositories and downloads when they don't work
---

If your download doesn't work, you can try the following troubleshooting steps:

* **Check your internet connection**: Make sure you are connected to the internet and that your connection is stable.

* **Check for errors in the terminal**: If the curl command responded with an error or just returns immediately with no output, there may be an issue with the command. Check the command and try again.

* **Check for 404 errors**: If you see a 404 error, its possible that your token doesn't entitle you to access the repository you have configured. Check the repository name and try again.

If none of these steps work, please contact [EDB Support](https://www.enterprisedb.com/support) for further assistance.
