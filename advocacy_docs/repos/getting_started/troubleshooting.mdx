description: How to troubleshoot your download when it doesn't work

If your download doesn't work, you can try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check your internet connection**: Make sure you are connected to the internet and that your connection is stable.
2. **Check for errors in the terminal**: If the curl command responded with an error or just returns immediately with no output, there may be an issue with the command. Check the command and try again.

If none of these steps work, please contact [EDB Support](https://www.enterprisedb.com/support) for further assistance.
