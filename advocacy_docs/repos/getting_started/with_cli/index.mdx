In this getting started section, you'll learn how to download and install the EDB package you need using the CLI. Using the CLI you can install from any EDB repository, including `community360`,`standard`,`enterprise`, and `postgres_distributed`.

There are three steps to installing packages from EDB repositories using the CLI. 

1. [Get your token](get_your_token)
2. [Add your repository](adding_edb_repositories)
3. [Install the package you need](install_named_package)

Once you've mastered package installation, you can move on to [working with repositories](../../working_with_repos) where you can learn how to directly browse repositories and download packages, create local mirrors, handle air-gapped installations, and integrate with configuration management tools.
