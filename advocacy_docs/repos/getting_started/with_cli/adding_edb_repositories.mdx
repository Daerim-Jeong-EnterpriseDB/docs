Using the command line allows you more flexibility in adding EDB repositories to your system. The website currently only supports Enterprise subscriptions, but the CLI allows you to add any EDB repository, including `community360`, `standard`, `enterprise`, and `postgres_distributed`.

See the [Repositories by name](/repos/reference/repositories_by_name) page for more information and what subscriptions are able to access them.

1. Get your token. If you don't have a token, [get it now](get_your_token) and return to this page when you have your token.

3. Save your token in the environment variable `$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN`:

    ```bash
    export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=your_token_here
    ``` 

4. Save your required repository name in the environment variable `$EDB_REPO`:

    ```bash
    export EDB_REPO=your_repository_name_here
    ```

5. Depending on your operating system, run the following command:

    **RHEL/AlmaLinux/RockyLinux/Oracle Linux and SUSE**:
        
    ```bash
    curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_REPO/setup.rpm.sh" | sudo -E bash
    ```

    **Ubuntu/Debian**:

    ```bash
    curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_REPO/setup.deb.sh" | sudo -E bash
    ```

6. You can now install packages from that EDB repository. Move on to the [installing named packages](install_named_package) to install the packages you need.

7. If you have any issues, check the [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting) section.
