Once you have added the EDB repository to your system, you can install any EDB package you need.

Finding the package name for the package you need.

Installation instructions in the manuals for the EDB packages will tell you the package name you need to install.
You can also look up the package name in the EDB Repos web page.

1. Navigate to [https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads). Sign in if required. If you do have to sign in, you'll be directed to the account profile page. On the account profile page, select **Repo Access** to continue.

2. Select **Access Repos 2.0**.

3. On the next page, select the platform you wish to download packages to.

4. Then select any software from the left hand list of EDB software.

6. Go to "Step 1" and copy the Auto command. This is a ready to run repository installer for your system. Run alone, it only installs the EDB repositories for Repos 2.0. EDB's web site has already personalized the command by embedding your token into the command, so you can run it as it.

7. Once complete, your system can download packages from EDB.

8. If you have any issues, check the [troubleshooting](troubleshooting) section.


For example, to install the EDB Postgres Advanced Server package, you would run the following command:

###
```bash
sudo dnf install edb-as
```
