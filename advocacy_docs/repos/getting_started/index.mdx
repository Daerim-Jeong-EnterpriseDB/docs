* [Getting started...using the Web Repos page](with_web): If you have an Enterprise subscription to EDB software, and want to use the web interface to guide you in downloading and installing packages, use this guide.

* [Getting started...using the CLI](with_cli): For all subscriptions, you can use the CLI to install packages from EDB repositories. This guide works for all EDB repositories and is the most flexible way to install packages.
