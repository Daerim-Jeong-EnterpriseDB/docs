There are three steps to installing packages from EDB repositories. 

1. [Get your token](get_your_token)
2. [Add your repository](add_your_repository)
3. [Install the package you need](install_package)

And if it doesn't work, there are some [troubleshooting](troubleshooting) tips for you.

Once you've mastered package installation, you can move on to [working with repositories](../working_with_repos) where you can learn how to directly browse repositories and download packages, create local mirrors, handle air-gapped installations, and integrate with configuration management tools.
