* [Using the web page](with_web): If you have an Enterprise subscription to EDB software, and want to use the web interface to guide you in downloading and installing packages, use this guide.

* [Using the CLI](with_cli): For all subscriptions, you can use the CLI to install packages from EDB repositories. This guide works for all EDB repositories and is the most flexible way to install packages.

!!! Note
 If you have an Standard or Community360 subscription, or want to install packages for Postgres Distributed without using TPA, you must use the CLI. Refer to the [CLI getting started guide](with_cli) for that.
