There are three steps to installing packages from EDB repositories. 

1. [Get your token](get_your_token)
2. [Add your repository](add_your_repository)
3. [Install the package you need](install_package)

Some EDB packages are only available from alternative EDB repositories. The steps are basically the same, but you need to know the name of the repository you want to add and the package name you want to install. This process applies to Postgres Distributed packages and Community360 packages.

1. [Get your token](get_your_token)
2. [Add other EDB repositories](add_other_repositories)
3. [Install the package you need](install_named_package)

Once you've mastered package installation, you can move on to [working with repositories](../working_with_repos) where you can learn how to directly browse repositories and download packages, create local mirrors, handle air-gapped installations, and integrate with configuration management tools.
