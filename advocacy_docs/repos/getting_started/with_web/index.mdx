To use this getting started section, you need to have an Enterprise subscription to EDB software. The web-based version of the repository system currently only supports Enterprise subscriptions.

!!! Note
If you want to install software from other EDB respositories, such as `community360` or `postgres_distributed`, you need to use the command line interface. Refer to the [CLI getting started guide](../with_cli) for that.
!!!

There are three steps to installing packages from EDB repositories using the Web. 

1. [Get your token](get_your_token)
2. [Add your repository](add_your_repository)
3. [Install the package you need](install_package)

Once you've mastered package installation, you can move on to [working with repositories](../../working_with_repos) where you can learn how to directly browse repositories and download packages, create local mirrors, handle air-gapped installations, and integrate with configuration management tools.
