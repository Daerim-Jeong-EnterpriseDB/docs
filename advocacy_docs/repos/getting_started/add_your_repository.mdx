2. Select **Access Repos 2.0**.

3. On the next page, select the platform you wish to download packages to.

4. Then select any software from the left hand list of EDB software.

5. On the right hand side, instructions appear for the installation of that particular software.

6. Go to "Step 1" and copy the Auto command. This is a ready to run repository installer for your system. Run alone, it only installs the EDB repositories for Repos 2.0. EDB's web site has already personalized the command by embedding your repos token into the command, so you can run it as it.

7. Once complete, your system can download packages from EDB.

8. If you have any issues, check the [troubleshooting](troubleshooting) section.
