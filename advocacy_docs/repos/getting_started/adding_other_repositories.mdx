description: How to add other EDB repositories to your system
---

The Repos 2.0 website currently directs users to their default enabled repositories. However, you can add other EDB repositories to your system, assuming you have the correct permissions on your plan.

The other available repositories are: `community360`, `standard`, `enterprise`, `postgres_extended`, `postgres_distributed`, and `postgres_distributed_4`. See the [Repositories by name](/reference/repositories_by_name) page for more information and what subscriptions are able to access them.

1. Get your token. If you don't have a token, [get it now](get_your_token) and return to this page when you have your token.

3. Save your token in the environment variable `$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN` like so.

    ```bash
    export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=your_token_here
    ``` 

4. Save your required repository name in the environment variable `$EDB_REPO` like so.

    ```bash
    export EDB_REPO=your_repository_name_here
    ```

5. Depending on your operating system, run the following command:

    **RHEL/AlmaLinux/RockyLinux and SUSE**:
        
    ```bash
    curl -1sLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_REPO/setup.rpm.sh" | sudo -E bash
    ```

    **Ubuntu/Debian**:

    ```bash
    curl -1sLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_REPO/setup.deb.sh" | sudo -E bash
    ```

6. You can now install packages from that EDB repository. Move on to the [installing named packages](install_named_package) to install the packages you need.

7. If you have any issues, check the [troubleshooting](troubleshooting) section.
