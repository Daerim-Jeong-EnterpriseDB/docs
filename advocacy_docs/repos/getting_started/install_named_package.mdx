2. Run the following command to install the package, depending on your operating system:

    **RHEL/AlmaLinux/RockyLinux**:

    ```bash
    sudo dnf -y install package_name
    ```

    **SUSE**:

    ```bash
    sudo zypper install package_name
    ```

    **Ubuntu/Debian**:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get -y install package_name
    ```
