The following table lists the old repository names used in Repos 1.0/2ndquadrant and their equivalent names in Repos 2.0.

If you have been installing from a named repository and are switching to Repos 2.0, find the new repository you will need to use in the table below. Then look up that repository in [Repositories by name](../reference/repositories_by_name) to find which subscription plan you should have to access that repository. If you have any issues, please contact EDB support.
