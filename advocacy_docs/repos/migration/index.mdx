There are two steps to this process and we recommend that you do them in order. The first step is to remove the old Repos 1.0 repositories from your system. The second step is to add the new Repos 2.0 repositories to your system. It is possible to perform the steps in the reverse order, but you will have to ensure that no proceses are run during the migration that may attempt to update or install packages. 

## Remove Repos 1.0 repositories

The first step is to remove the Repos 1.0 entry from your machines repository list.

### Debian/Ubuntu

Run

```
sudo su -c 'rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
```


### RHEL and derivatives

Run

```
sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
```


### SUSE

Run

```
zypper rr https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
```


## Add Repos 2.0 Repositories

The next step is to add the Repos 2.0 repositories to your machine. This will require you to have an EDB account.  

1. Navigate to [https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads). Sign in if required. If you do have to sign in, you'll be directed to the account profile page. On the account profile page, click on **Access Repos** to continue.

2. Select Access Repos 2.0.

3. On the next page, select the platform you wish to download packages to.

4. Then select any software from the left hand list of EDB software.

5. On the right hand side, instructions appear for the installation of that particular software.

6. Go to "Step 1" and copy the Auto command. This is a ready to run repository installer for your system. Run alone, it only installs the EDB repositories for Repos 2.0.

7. Once complete, your system can download packages from EDB again, but this time from the EDB Repos 2.0 system.
