There are two steps to this process and we recommend that you do them in order. The first step is to remove the old Repos 1.0 repositories from your system. The second step is to add the new Repos 2.0 repositories to your system. It is possible to perform the steps in the reverse order, but you will have to ensure that no proceses are run during the migration that may attempt to update or install packages. 

## Remove Repos 1.0 repositories

The first step is to remove the Repos 1.0 entry from your machines repository list.

### Debian/Ubuntu

Run

```
sudo su -c 'rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
```


### RHEL and derivatives

Run

```
sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
```


### SUSE

Run

```
zypper rr https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
```


## Add Repos 2.0 Repositories

The next step is to add the Repos 2.0 repositories to your machine. You can use the directions in the [Getting started](getting_started) section. 

* For all other subscriptions and software, refer to the [Getting started using repositories on the command line](getting_started/with_cli) page.
* Unless you want to use the web interface and only have an Enterprise subscription, in which case, refer to the [Getting started using repositories on the web](getting_started/with_web) page.
