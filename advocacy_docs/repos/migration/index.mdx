## Remove Repos 1.0 Repositories

The first step is to remove the Repos 1.0 entry from your machines repository list.

```

</details>

<details><summary>RHEL and derivatives</summary>

Run

```

```
</details>

<details><summary>SUSE</summary>

```
</details>

## Add Repos 2.0 Repositories

1. Navigate to https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads. Sign in if required.

2. Select Access Repos 2.0.

3. On the next page, select the platform you wish to configure to download packages to.

4. Then select any software from the left hand list of EDB software.

5. On the right hand side, instructions will appear for the installation of that particular software.

6. Go to "Step 1" and copy the Auto command. This is a ready to run repository installer for your system. Run alone, it only installs the EDB repositories for Repos 2.0.

7. Once complete, your system can download packages from EDB again, but this time from the EDB Repos 2.0 system.
