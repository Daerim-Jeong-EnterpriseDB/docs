!!! Warning Repos 1.0 sunset
The Repos 1.0 repositories are due to be sunset by the end of October 2024, after which time there will be no more access to them. We recommend that you migrate to the Repos 2.0 repositories as soon as possible.
!!!

There are two steps to this process and we recommend that you do them in order. The first step is to remove the old Repos 1.0 repositories from your system. The second step is to add the new Repos 2.0 repositories to your system. It's possible to perform the steps in the reverse order, but you have to ensure that no processes are running during the migration that may attempt to update or install packages. 

## Remove Repos 1.0 repositories

The first step is to remove the Repos 1.0 entry from your machines repository list.

### Debian/Ubuntu

Run

```
sudo su -c 'rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
```


### RHEL and derivatives

Run

```
sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
```


### SUSE

Run

```
zypper rr https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
```


## Add Repos 2.0 Repositories

The next step is to add the Repos 2.0 repositories to your machine. You can use the directions in the [Getting started](../getting_started) section. 

* For all other subscriptions and software, refer to the [Getting started using repositories on the command line](../getting_started/with_cli) page.
* Unless you want to use the web interface and only have an Enterprise subscription, in which case, refer to the [Getting started using repositories on the web](../getting_started/with_web) page.
