description: How to install EDB packages in an airgapped environment
---

For airgapped installations, you need to download the packages and their dependencies from the EDB repository and then transfer them to the airgapped environment. For details on how to download packages, see [Building local mirrors](building_local_mirrors). This shows how you can create a directory which contains all the packages and their dependencies that you need to install. 

It's this directory which you can then transfer to the airgapped environment. Within the airgapped environment, you can then create a local repository and install the packages from there.
