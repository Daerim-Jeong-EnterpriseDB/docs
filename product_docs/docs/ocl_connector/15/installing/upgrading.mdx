If you have an existing OCL Connector installation on a Linux platform, you can upgrade your repository configuration file, which enables access to the current EDB repository. Then you can upgrade to a more recent version of OCL Connector.

To update the `edb.repo` file:

```shell
# Update your repository configuration file
sudo <package-manager> upgrade edb-repo

# Upgrade the installed product
sudo <package-manager> upgrade edb-oci

sudo <package-manager> upgrade edb-oci-devel
```

Where `<package-manager>` is the package manager used with your operating system:

  | Package manager |         Operating system         |
  | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
  | yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
  | zypper          | SLES                             |
  | apt-get         | Debian and Ubuntu                |


## Upgrading libpq 

You may need to upgrade the EDB Postgres Advanced Server libpq library to a required version on the client machine where you installed EDB OCL Connector. Any new libpq version dependencies are listed in the release notes. If you need to upgrade libpq, run the appropriate command for your operating system.

### For Ubuntu/Debian

```
sudo apt-get install edb-as15-libpq5
```

### For RHEL and SLES 

```
sudo <package-manager> install edb-as15-server-libs
```

Where `<package-manager>` is the package manager used with your operating system:

| Package manager |         Operating system         |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
| yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
| zypper          | SLES                             |
