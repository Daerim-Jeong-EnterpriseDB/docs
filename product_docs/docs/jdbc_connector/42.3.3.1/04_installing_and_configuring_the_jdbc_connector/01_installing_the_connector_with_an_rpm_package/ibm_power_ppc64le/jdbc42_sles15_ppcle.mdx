navTitle: SLES 15
title: Installing EDB JDBC Connector on SLES 15 ppc64le
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on a host that the product can connect to using a connection string. It doesn't need to be on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).
- Review [Supported JDBC distributions](/jdbc_connector/latest/02_requirements_overview/#supported-jdk-distribution).

- Log in as a superuser:

  ```shell
  sudo su -
  ```

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

## Install the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-jdbc
```

## Initial configuration

To make the JDBC driver available to Java, you must either copy the appropriate java `.jar` file for the JDBC version that you are using to your `$java_home/jre/lib/ext` directory or append the location of the `.jar` file to the `CLASSPATH` environment variable.

Note that if you choose to append the location of the `jar` file to the `CLASSPATH` environment variable, you must include the complete pathname:

`/usr/edb/jdbc/edb-jdbc18.jar`
