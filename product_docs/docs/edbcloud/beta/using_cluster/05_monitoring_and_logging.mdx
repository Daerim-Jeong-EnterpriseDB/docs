title: "Monitoring and Logging"
---

EDB Cloud sends all metrics and logs from PostgreSQL clusters to Azure.
Pre-defined dashboards and metrics queries are provided as a starting point for
exploring the available data.

As every customer's needs are different, it is anticipated that applying Azure
Monitor features to the supplied data streams will enable customers to create
tailored insights into their workloads in order to better meet their business
goals.


### Azure Log Analytics

When EDB Cloud deploys workloads on Azure, the logs from the postgres
clusters are forwarded to the Azure Log Workspace.

A pre-defined shared dashboard panel shows recent postgres logs. For more
in-depth querying of the EDB Cloud logs, you must use
[Azure Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)
with the
[Kusto Query language](https://azure-training.com/azure-data-science/the-kusto-query-language/).


###  Using shared dashboards to view PostgreSQL cluster logs and metrics

To view logs and selected metrics summaries from your PostgreSQL clusters using
Shared Dashboard:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **Resource Groups**.
2. Select the Resource Group corresponding to the region where you choose to
   deploy your EDB Cloud cluster. You will see resources included in that
   Resource Group.
3. Select the resource of type _Shared Dashboard_ with the suffix -customer.
4. Select the **Go to dashboard** link located at the top of the page.

The default shared dashboard provided by EDB Cloud will be extended and
enhanced over time. It includes panels for monitoring and diagnostic
information like:

* Recent log entries for all clusters
* Row insert, update, and delete rates per database
* Query deadlock rates
* Connection counts over time
* Temporary storage use trend
* Replication lag
* Age of longest running transaction

!!! Important
Changes you make to the shared dashboard will be overwritten when
EDB Cloud updates are deployed. Create your own custom dashboard if you wish to
modify or extend the provided dashboard. You can start with the EDB Cloud dashboard
by using the "Clone" button in the dashboard view.

### Querying PostgreSQL cluster logs and metrics

All logs from your PostgreSQL clusters are stored in the _Customer Log
Analytics workspace_. To find your _Customer Log Analytics workspace_:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **Resource Groups**.
2. Select the Resource Group corresponding to the region where you choose to
   deploy your EDB Cloud cluster. You will see resources included in that Resource
   Group.
3. Select the resource of type _Log Analytics workspace_ with the suffix -customer.
4. Select the Logs in the menu on the left in the General section.
5. Close the dashboard with pre-built queries. This will bring you to the KQL Editor.

#### Available Logs and Metrics

See the next section [Metrics Details](#metrics-details-list) for a listing of
available metrics and details on the structure of log entries.

#### Example Log Queries

For example,

```
PostgresLogs_CL
| project record_log_time_s, record_error_severity_s, record_detail_s
| sort by record_log_time_s desc

PostgresAuditLogs_CL
| where logger_s == "pgaudit"
| project record_log_time_s, record_error_severity_s, record_audit_statement_s
| sort by record_log_time_s desc

PostgresAuditLogs_CL
| where logger_s == "edb_audit"
| project record_log_time_s, record_error_severity_s, record_message_s
| sort by record_log_time_s desc
```


#### Example Metrics Queries

To list the metrics from EDB Cloud presently available in the `InsightsMetrics`
table use this query:

```
InsightsMetrics
| where Namespace == "prometheus"
| distinct Name
```

(Or just use Metrics Explorer).
