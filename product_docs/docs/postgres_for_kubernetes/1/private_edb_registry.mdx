The images for the *EDB Postgres for Kubernetes* operator, as well as various
operands, are kept in private container image registries under
`docker.enterprisedb.com`.

!!! Important
    Access to the private registries requires an account with EDB and is
    reserved to EDB customers with a valid [subscription plan](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/plans-comparison#selfmanagedenterpriseplan).
    Credentials will be funneled through your EDB account.

!!! Important
    There is a bandwidth quota of 10GB/month per registry.

!!! Note
    When installing the operator and operands from the private registry, the
    [license keys](./license_keys.md) are not needed.

## Which repository to choose?

EDB Postgres for Kubernetes is available with either of
"EDB Enterprise Plan" or "EDB Standard Plan".

Depending on your subscription plan, EDB Postgres for Kubernetes
will be in one of the following repositories, as described in the table below:

| Plan                  | Repository       |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
| EDB Standard Plan     | `k8s_standard`   |
| EDB EnterpriseDB Plan | `k8s_enterprise` |

The name of the repository shall be used as the *Username* when you try to
login to the EDB container registry, for example through `docker login` or a
[`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` pull secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#secret-types).

!!! Important
    Each repository contains all the images you can access with your plan.
    You don't need to connect to different repositories to access different
    images, such as operator or operand images.

## How to retrieve the token

In the [repositories page in EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads),
you'll find an *EDB Repos 2.0* section where a `Repo Token` is shown, obscured.
The same token is also be available in your
[Account profile](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/profile), labeled
as `Repos 2.0 token`.

Next to the token you'll find a button to copy the token, and an eye icon
in case you want to view the content of the token as clear text.
The token shall be used as the *Password* when you try to login to EDB
container registry.

### Example with `docker login`

You should be able to login via Docker from your terminal. We suggest you
copy the Repo Token using the `Copy Token` button. The `docker` command below
will prompt you for a username and a password.

As explained above, the username should be the repository you are trying to
access while the password is the token you just copied.

```sh
$ docker login docker.enterprisedb.com  
Username: k8s_enterprise
Password: 
Login Succeeded
```

## Operand images

EDB Postgres for Kubernetes supports various PostgreSQL distributions that have
images available from the same private registries:

-   EDB Postgres Advanced
-   EDB Postgres Extended

!!! Note
    PostgreSQL images are not available in the private registries, but are
    readily available on `quay.io/enterprisedb/postgresql` or
    `ghcr.io/enterprisedb/postgresql`.

These images follow the requirements and the conventions described in the
["Container image requirements"](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/container_images/)
page of the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation.

In the table below you can find the image name prefix for each Postgres distribution:

| Postgres distribution | Image name              | Repositories     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| EDB Postgres Extended | `edb-postgres-extended` | `k8s_standard`   |
| EDB Postgres Advanced | `edb-postgres-advanced` | `k8s_enterprise` |

## How to install the operator using the EDB private registry

As mentioned above, the *username* for docker is the name of your repository,
and the token is the *password*.
The same credentials can be used for kubernetes to access the registry by
setting up a [`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` pull secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#secret-types).

As mentioned in the [installation document](./installation_upgrade.md), there
are several different ways to install the operator.

If you are going to install using images from the private registry, you will
need to create a pull secret, as we have mentioned, and also customize the
`OPERATOR_IMAGE_NAME` parameter in the deployment manifest.

We suggest to use the Helm chart for installation, which will take care of
creating the pull secret and customizing the operator image repository
for you.

You can find more information in the [Helm chart](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts) page.

As an example, the following command (provided the token) will install the PG4K
operator when using the repository from the EDB EnterpriseDB Plan:

```sh
helm upgrade --install edb-pg4k \
  --namespace postgresql-operator-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --set image.repository=docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes \
  --set image.imageCredentials.username=k8s_enterprise \
  --set image.imageCredentials.password=<ENTITLEMENT_TOKEN> \
  --set image.imageCredentials.create=true \
  --set "imagePullSecrets[0].name"=postgresql-operator-pull-secret \
  --set config.data.PULL_SECRET_NAME=postgresql-operator-pull-secret \
  edb/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes
```
