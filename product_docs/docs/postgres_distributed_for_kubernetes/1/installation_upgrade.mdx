## Kubernetes

### Installation using Helm

You can install EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes using the provided
[Helm chart](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts).

If you don't have [Helm](https://helm.sh) installed yet, follow the
[instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) to install it on your
system.

Once Helm is installed, add the repository:

```console
helm repo add edb https://enterprisedb.github.io/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts/
```

You need credentials to enable `helm` to retrieve the various
operator and operand images that are stored in private repositories.
Make sure to replace your username and password
in this command:

```console
helm upgrade --dependency-update \
  --install edb-pg4k-pgd \
  --namespace pgd-operator-system \
  --create-namespace \
  edb/edb-postgres-distributed-for-kubernetes \
  --set image.imageCredentials.username=${REPO} \
  --set image.imageCredentials.password=${TOKEN}
```

Set `REPO` to either `k8s_enterprise_pgd` or `k8s_standard_pgd`, depending on the EDB software subscription purchased and Postgres distribution you're installing. Use `k8s_enterprise_pgd` if you're in a trial period or are a preview user.

Set `TOKEN` to the repository token for your EDB account. You can obtain this by signing in on the [Repos page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) on the EDB website, and then displaying the EDB Repos 2.0 token. Select **Reveal Token**, or copy it by selecting **Copy**.

For further details on the Helm chart, see
[Helm chart repo](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts).

!!! Important
    Carefully read the [release notes](release_notes.md)
    before performing an upgrade as some versions might require
    extra steps.

## Red Hat OpenShift

### Installation using the web console

You can find the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator in the Red Hat OperatorHub
directly from your OpenShift dashboard.

1.  Navigate in the web console to the **Operators > OperatorHub** page:

    ![Menu OperatorHub](./images/openshift/operatorhub_1.png)

2.  Use the search box to restrict the listing, for example, using `EDB` or `pgd`:

    ![Install OperatorHub](./images/openshift/find-pgd-openshift.png)

3.  Read the information about the operator, and select **Install**.

4.  The Operator Installation page expects you to choose:

    -   The installation mode: [cluster-wide](#cluster-wide-installation) is currently the
        only mode.
    -   The update channel (currently **alpha**).
    -   The approval strategy, following the availability on the marketplace of
        a new release of the operator, certified by Red Hat:
        -   **Automatic**: OLM automatically upgrades the running operator with the
            new version.
        -   **Manual**:  OpenShift waits for human intervention by requiring an
            approval in the Installed Operators section.

#### Cluster-wide installation

With cluster-wide installation, you're asking OpenShift to install the
operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace and to make it
available to all the projects in the cluster. This is the default and normally
recommended approach to install EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes.

From the web console, select **All namespaces on the cluster (default)** for
**Installation mode**:

![Install all namespaces](./images/openshift/all-namespaces.png)

As a result, the operator is visible in every namespace. Otherwise, as with any
other OpenShift operator, check the logs in any pods in the `openshift-operators`
project on the **Workloads > Pods** page that are reporting issues to troubleshoot further.

!!! Important "Beware"
    By choosing the cluster-wide installation, you can't easily move to a
    single-project installation later.

### Creating a PGD cluster

After the installation from OpenShift, find the operator deployment
in the `openshift-operators` namespace. Notice the cert-manager operator was
also installed.

```sh
$ oc get deployments -n openshift-operators
NAME                                            READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
cert-manager-operator                           1/1     1            1           11m
pgd-operator-controller-manager                 1/1     1            1           11m
postgresql-operator-controller-manager-1-20-0   1/1     1            1           23h
â€¦
```

After verifying that the `pgd-operator-controller-manager` deployment is READY, you can
start creating PGD clusters. See [Examples of configuration](samples.md) for sample files.

Remember to deploy your PGD clusters on a dedicated namespace. The default
namespace is reserved.

First, then, create a namespace, and deploy a self-signed
certificate `Issuer` in it:

```sh
oc create ns my-namespace
oc apply -f hack/samples/issuer-selfsigned.yaml -n my-namespace
```

Now you can deploy a PGD cluster, for example, a flexible 3-region that
contains two data groups and a witness group:

```sh
oc apply -f docs/src/samples/flexible_3regions.yaml -n my-namespace
```

Your PGD groups start to appear:

```sh
$ oc get pgdgroups -n my-namespace
NAME       DATA INSTANCES   WITNESS INSTANCES   PHASE                PHASE DETAILS   AGE
region-a   2                1                   PGDGroup - Healthy                   23m
region-b   2                1                   PGDGroup - Healthy                   23m
region-c   0                1                   PGDGroup - Healthy                   23m
```
