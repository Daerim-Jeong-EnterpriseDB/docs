title: "Version 4.8"
---

Enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in EFM 4.8 include:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | The minimum Java version required to run Failover Manager is now version 11 instead of 8. |
| Enhancement | The minimum database server version now supported is 11.  |
| Enhancement | New CLI command 'efm reset-members added' to remove cached node addreses after a node is removed from a cluster.  |
| Enhancement | Changed the order to retrieve WAL replay/receive queries from a standby during a cluster status call. This can help avoid confusing output when the database cluster is under load. |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager agents can be started before the local database has been initialized. |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager will now log more information about outside processes attempting to connect to a running agent's address/port. |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager will no longer start if ping==VIP. (TODO: want this one?). |
| Enhancement | Placeholder text. [Support tickets: #12345, #12346] |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an edge case that could result in two primary nodes in the case of an even split of a cluster (e.g. between two data centers with equal number of nodes). |
| Bug Fix | TODO: During a cluster shutdown, the coordinator will wait a couple seconds before exiting to prevent edge cases of other nodes logging warnings about cluster communication problems. |
| Bug Fix | Placeholder text. [Support ticket #23456]|
