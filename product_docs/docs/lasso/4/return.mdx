title: Returning the Lasso report
---

The script produces a _TAR file_ in the same directory where you
executed Lasso, containing the gathered data: this is the
"Lasso report".

You can also use Lasso on a server that has no
Postgres installation. In that case, use the
`--system-only` option, and the _TAR file_ produced will contain only
system-related information.

Unless you are running Lasso on an isolated network system, without
external access to EnterpriseDB's infrastructure, you can upload the
produced tarball directly through Lasso using the `--upload` option. For
more information, see [Servers accepting upload of reports](appendix-a).

Alternatively, you can attach the report to a specific support ticket
through the Portal or use the **Support operations > Upload report** menu
from your company's page.
