title: Returning the Lasso report
---

The script produces a TAR file containing the gathered data 
in the directory where you executed Lasso. This file is the
Lasso report.

You can also use Lasso on a server that has no
Postgres installation. In that case, use the
`--system-only` option to produce a TAR file that contains only
system-related information.

Unless you're running Lasso on an isolated network system, without
external access to EDB's infrastructure, you can upload the
produced tarball directly through Lasso using the `--upload` option. For
more information, see [Servers accepting upload of reports](appendix-a).

Alternatively, you can attach the report to a specific support ticket
through the Portal. Or, use the **Support operations > Upload report** menu
from your company's page.
