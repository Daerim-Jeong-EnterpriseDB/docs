title: "Automated diagnostics gathering"
---

The process of automated diagnostics gathering is performed by
a small multi-platform application written in Python.

Lasso can also be run on systems where PostgreSQL is not
installed, in order to gather all relevant information regarding the
underlying operating system.

Please consult the specific section for your operating system.

!!! Important
Lasso is harmless. It simply gathers
statistics and diagnostics information from your PostgreSQL server,
with imperceptible effects on the workload. *No actual data* from
the rows of your PostgreSQL user tables is gathered. [^SOURCE]
