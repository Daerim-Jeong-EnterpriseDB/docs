title: "Automated diagnostics gathering"
---

The process of automated diagnostics gathering is performed by
a small multi-platform application written in Python.

You can also run Lasso on systems where PostgreSQL isn't
installed to gather all relevant information regarding the
underlying operating system.

Consult the specific information for your operating system.

!!! Important
Lasso can't affect your data. It gathers
statistics and diagnostics information from your PostgreSQL server,
with imperceptible effects on the workload. *No actual data* from
the rows of your PostgreSQL user tables is gathered. [^SOURCE]

[^SOURCE]: Gathered diagnostics data files are available for your inspection.
