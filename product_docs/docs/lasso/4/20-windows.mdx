### Requirements

Windows Server 2008 r2 or newer

### Usage

Expand the distribution zip file in a folder.

A standard Lasso run consists of:

```
    lasso.exe
```

!!! Important
The process must run in an elevated environment,
such as an elevated command prompt or with the *Run as administrator** context menu option.
!!!

Lasso writes the output file in the working directory.

!!! Important
Lasso is distributed as a 64-bit executable.
!!!

### PEM report

Lasso can run on systems where PEM is installed. In that
case, it also gathers PEM-related information, like some configuration
files and information about services.

Lasso inspects the well-known paths for configuration files,
as well as well-known service names. If you have custom PEM installations,
Lasso doesn't gather the related information.


### xDB report

Lasso can run on systems where xDB is installed. In that
case, it gathers xDB-related information.

In general, if you installed xDB using EDB-certified packages, all you
need to do is execute Lasso.

#### How Lasso finds the xDB configuration file

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the xDB
configuration files. It uses the first one it finds:

1. Use the ones provided through `--xdb-pubserver-configuration` and
`--xdb-subserver-configuration` options, if given.
2. Check the paths provided by xDB 7 packages. The configuration files are usually
put under `<drive>:\Program Files\edb\EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer\etc`.
Lasso inspects this folder, if it exists, and uses the `xdb_pubserver.conf` and
`xdb_subserver.conf` files found under that folder.
3. Check the paths provided by xDB 7 packages. The configuration files are usually
put under `<drive>:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer\etc`.
Lasso inspects this folder, if it exists, and uses the `xdb_pubserver.conf`
and `xdb_subserver.conf` files found under that folder.

#### How Lasso finds the xDB binary

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the xDB
binary files. It uses the first one it finds:

1. Check the paths provided by xDB 7 packages. The binary files are usually
put under `<drive>:\Program Files\edb\EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer\bin`.
Lasso inspects this folder, if it exists, and uses the `edb-repcli.jar` file found
under that folder.
2. Check the paths provided by xDB 7 packages. The binary files are usually
put under `<drive>:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer\bin`.
Lasso inspects this folder, if it exists, and uses the `edb-repcli.jar`
file found under that folder.

#### Managing custom installations of EFM

You can point to a specific xDB publication or subscription server configuration
file by using the `--xdb-pubserver-configuration` and `--xdb-subserver-configuration`
options, as follows:

```
    lasso.exe --xdb-pubserver-configuration C:\\xDB\pubserver.conf --xdb-subserver-configuration C:\\xDB\subserver.conf
```

This approach is preferred, as it guarantees Lasso will use
the correct xDB configuration files instead of trying to find it automatically.

#### System-only report

Lasso can also run on systems where PostgreSQL isn't
installed to gather all relevant information regarding the
underlying operating system.

You can run a system-only report with the following command:

```
    lasso.exe --system-only
```
