### Requirements

1. Windows Server 2008 r2 or newer;

### Usage

Expand the distribution zip file in a folder.

A standard Lasso run consists of:

    $ lasso.exe

!!! Important
The process must be run in an elevated environment
such as an elevated command prompt or with the *"Run as administrator"*
contextual menu option.
!!!

Lasso will write the output file in the working directory.

!!! Important
Lasso is distributed as a 64-bit executable.
!!!

### PEM report

Lasso can be run on systems where PEM is installed. In that
case, it will also gather PEM-related information, like some configuration
files and information about services.

Lasso will inspect the well known paths for configuration files,
as well as well known service names. If you have custom PEM installations,
Lasso will not gather the related information.


### xDB report

Lasso can be run on systems where xDB is installed. In that
case, it will gather xDB-related information.

In general, if you have installed xDB using EDB certified packages, all you
need to do is execute Lasso.

#### How Lasso finds the xDB configuration file

Lasso will use the below approach while trying to identify the xDB
configuration files, and will use the first one which is found:

1. Use the ones provided through `--xdb-pubserver-configuration` and
`--xdb-subserver-configuration` options, if given
2. Check the paths provided by xDB 7 packages. The configuration files are usually
put under `<drive>:\Program Files\edb\EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer\etc`.
Lasso will inspect this folder, if it exists, and use the `xdb_pubserver.conf` and
`xdb_subserver.conf` found under that folder.
3. Check the paths provided by xDB 7 packages. The configuration files are usually
put under `<drive>:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer\etc`.
Lasso will inspect this folder, if it exists, and use the `xdb_pubserver.conf`
and `xdb_subserver.conf` found under that folder.

#### How Lasso finds the xDB binary

Lasso will use the below approach while trying to identify the xDB
binary files, and will use the first one which is found:

1. Check the paths provided by xDB 7 packages. The binary files are usually
put under `<drive>:\Program Files\edb\EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer\bin`.
Lasso will inspect this folder, if it exists, and use the `edb-repcli.jar` found
under that folder.
2. Check the paths provided by xDB 7 packages. The binary files are usually
put under `<drive>:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer\bin`.
Lasso will inspect this folder, if it exists, and use the `edb-repcli.jar`
found under that folder.

#### Managing custom installations of EFM

You can point to a specific xDB publication and/or subscription server configuration
file, by using the `--xdb-pubserver-configuration` and `--xdb-subserver-configuration`
options, as follows:

    $ lasso.exe --xdb-pubserver-configuration C:\\xDB\pubserver.conf --xdb-subserver-configuration C:\\xDB\subserver.conf

This is actually the preferred approach, as it guarantees Lasso will use
the correct xDB configuration files instead of trying to find it automatically.


#### System only report

Lasso can also be run on systems where PostgreSQL is not
installed, in order to gather all relevant information regarding the
underlying operating system.

You can run a system-only report with the following command:

    $ lasso.exe --system-only
