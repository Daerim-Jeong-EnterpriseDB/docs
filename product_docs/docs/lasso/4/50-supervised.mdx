Lasso can't detect certain information.
You must provide detailed information about the
server running PostgreSQL and the database system architecture,
including business continuity implementations, such as
availability and disaster recovery.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of questions for your
network, system, and database administrators.
(You might find you need additional information.)

## General architecture

- What are the main use cases for your databases?
    - Client applications and tools
    - Frameworks and programming languages
- What's your current high-availability strategy for PostgreSQL?
- What's your current disaster-recovery strategy for PostgreSQL?
    - Describe your backup strategy.
    - Is it regularly being tested? 
    - Do you have dedicated hardware for the recovery and testing of your backups? 
- Are you using any connection poolers for PostgreSQL? If yes, which ones?
- What's the network architecture around your database server?

## Hardware related

- What's the configuration of the disks?
    - Brand and model of the disks
    - Brand and model of the controller/interface, where applicable
    - Brand and model of any device for disk management (SAN, NAS, and so on), where applicable
    - RAID configuration, where applicable
    - Configuration of write cache
    - Battery status, where applicable
    - Multipath configuration, where applicable
    - LVM physical volume dump, where applicable
- Is the server protected by a UPS?

## Software related

- Is the server virtual?
    - Which technology is used for virtualization?
- Software RAID configuration, where applicable
- Are you using any trending/monitoring tools (that is, Cacti, ZenOS, Zabbix, and so on)?
- Are you using any alerting tools (that is, Nagios/Icinga, ZenOS, Zabbix, and so on)?
- Do you use any record-based software for replication in PostgreSQL (that is, Slony, Bucardo, Londiste, and so on)?
- Have you ever used the pg_upgrade tool to upgrade your PostgreSQL server? What
  version did you upgrade this way?

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

If you have PostgreSQL on Amazon instances:

- If using AWS, what's the size of your instances?
- Can you provide information on the regions of the servers?
- Are you using CloudWatch?
- Are you using VPC?
- In case of S3 backups, are you using any encryption for your backups and archives?
