As stated in the introduction, some information cannot be
automatically detected by Lasso.

The customer must provide detailed information about the
server running PostgreSQL and the database system architecture,
including business continuity implementations, such as
availability and disaster recovery.

Below is a non exhaustive list of questions for your
(the customer's) network, system and database administrators.
Feel free to add more information if necessary.

- What is your current high availability strategy for PostgreSQL?
- What is your current disaster recovery strategy for PostgreSQL?
    - Please describe your backup strategy
    - Is it regularly being tested? 
    - Do you have dedicated hardware for the recovery and testing of your backups? 
- Are you using any connection pooler for PostgreSQL? If yes, which one(s)?
- What is the network architecture around your database server?


## Hardware related

- What is the configuration of the disks?
    - Brand and model of the disks
