title: Installing Lasso
---

EDB distributes the application through the
[EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres)
and grants usage to customers using a *company token* as a means of
authentication.


## Linux

You can install Lasso on any major supported Linux distribution by following
the corresponding Linux installation option for your system from the
[EDB Downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres).
Or you can install it directly from the
[EDB repositories for Linux page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos).
Choose Lasso and following the installation instructions.

After installing the EDB repository for your subscription on your system,
you can install Lasso on Linux using the package manager tool
for your Linux distribution. Examples include (but aren't limited to):

- Debian / Ubuntu:

```
    apt install edb-lasso
```

- RHEL / CentOS / Oracle Linux 7:

```
    yum install edb-lasso
```

- RHEL / Rocky / AlmaLinux / Oracle Linux 8+:

```
    dnf install edb-lasso
```

If your system has Internet access, then installing the `edb-lasso`
package using your package manager installs these
Lasso dependencies:

- `python3`
- `python3-psycopg2`
- `python3-setuptools`
- `python3-psutil`

If your system doesn't Internet access, then you need to download these dependencies
and install them manually. Consult EDB Support for more
details.


## Windows

Lasso for Windows is a single-file binary executable called
`lasso-windows-X.Y.Z.exe`, where `X.Y.Z` is the current Lasso version. You
can download it from the
[EDB Downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres).

On Windows, Lasso doesn't require installing any dependencies, but Lasso
can run only on Windows Server 2008 R2 or later.


## Configuration file

If you try to run Lasso without a configuration file, this error occurs:

```
    ERROR: no configuration file for Lasso could be found. Please create a configuration file and try again.
```

Lasso requires a configuration file, which can be one of the following
options. (It uses the first match.)

- `./edb-lasso.cfg` in the same directory where Lasso is running
- `./edb-lasso.conf` in the same directory where Lasso is running
- `$HOME/.edb-lasso.conf`
- `/etc/edb-lasso.conf`

The minimum configuration file looks like this:

```
[customer]
id=XXXXX
token=YYYYYYYYY
```

Replace the `id` and `token` with the information found in your
company page in the Support Portal. (In the left menu bar, select
**Company info > Company**.) Enter the **Company code** value from this page
in the `id` field in the configuration file. Enter the
**Token** value in the `token` field in the 
configuration file.

!!! Important
A configuration file for Lasso is mandatory, at least
with the customer id and token.
!!!

For more details about the Lasso configuration, see
[Configuration](configuration).


## Executing Lasso

After installing Lasso and creating an appropriate configuration file,
a standard Lasso execution on Linux is:

```
    lasso
```

On Windows, to run Lasso, you need to do the following:

1. In the Start menu, search for `cmd`.
2. Right-click Command Prompt and select **Run as administrator**.
3. If Windows prompts you to allow Command Prompt to make changes in the system, select **Yes**.
4. Inside the Command Prompt, `cd` to the directory where the Lasso `.exe` file is located.
4. Execute the command `lasso-windows-X.Y.Z.exe`, where `X.Y.Z` is the Lasso version.

```
    lasso-windows-X.Y.Z.exe -H IP_ADDRESS -p PORT --password PASSWORD DATABASE_NAME USER_NAME
```

Alternatively, if you fill in the settings under the `postgresql` section
in the configuration file telling Lasso how to connect to Postgres, then
you can execute Lasso from the Windows Explorer. Right-click the
`.exe` file, and then select **Run as administrator**.

For more details on the many Lasso options, see [Usage](usage).
