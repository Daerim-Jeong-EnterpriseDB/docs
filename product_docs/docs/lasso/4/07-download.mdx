title: 'How to download Lasso'
---

EDB has developed a small multi-platform application called **Lasso** that is
able to safely gather relevant diagnostics data on a system where PostgreSQL
(and/or other relevant supported software such as Barman) is running.

EDB distributes the application in a binary form via the
[Customer Portal](https://techsupport.enterprisedb.com/),
and grants usage to its customers using their *company token* as a means of authentication.

!!! Important
Please consider Lasso as a disposable application.
Always download the application before exporting a report (or a series of
reports), as the application is in continuous deployment mode.
!!!

In order to download Lasso for your system, follow the
"Lasso" link in the left panel of the Portal.

Unless your company has requested a version of Lasso for
an isolated network system, without external access to EnterpriseDB's
infrastructure (see "Appendix A"), you can upload the produced tarball
directly through Lasso with the `--upload` option.

Alternatively, you can attach the report to a specific support ticket
through the Portal or use the "Support operations / Upload report" menu
from your company's page.
