title: 'Downloading Lasso'
---

EDB has developed a small multi-platform application called Lasso that 
can safely gather relevant diagnostics data on a system where PostgreSQL
and other relevant supported software, such as Barman, is running.

EDB distributes the application in a binary form by way of the
[Customer Portal](https://techsupport.enterprisedb.com/)
and grants usage to its customers using their *company token* as a means of authentication.

!!! Important
Consider Lasso a disposable application.
Always download the application before exporting a report (or a series of
reports), as the application is in continuous deployment mode.
!!!

To download Lasso for your system, use the
**Lasso** link in the left panel of the Portal.

Unless your company has requested a version of Lasso for
an isolated network system, without external access to EnterpriseDB's
infrastructure, you can upload the produced tarball
directly through Lasso with the `--upload` option. For more information, see [Servers accepting upload of reports](96-appendix-a).

Alternatively, you can attach the report to a specific support ticket
through the Portal or use the **Support operations > Upload report** menu
from your company's page.
