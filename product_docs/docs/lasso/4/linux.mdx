## Requirements

Glibc 2.5 or newer


## Postgres and BDR3 report

As the user postgres, copy the Lasso binary into a folder.

!!! Important
The same user that runs the Postgres server process must run the command. 
The user must have permission to write
in the current working directory.
!!!

A standard Lasso run consists of:

```
    ./lasso
```

Lasso writes the output file in the current working directory.

!!! Warning
Lasso needs to execute files from the
temporary directory. If your system temporary directory is mounted
with the `noexec` flag, the following error occurs:

```
    ./lasso: error while loading shared libraries:
    libz.so.1: failed to map segment from shared object:
    Operation not permitted
```

In that case, you can specify a different temporary file location
using the `TMPDIR` environment variable:
```
    TMPDIR=/some/alternate/tmp/location ./lasso`
```
!!!

!!! Important
When run on a local instance, Lasso
requires a user that belongs to the pg_monitor role, which is available
in Postgres 10 and later. Before 10, you must run as
a superuser. For more information, see 
[Default Roles](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/default-roles.html)in the PostgreSQL documentation.
!!!

Lasso transparently gathers information related to
all supported versions of EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) and pglogical.

## Barman report

Lasso can run on systems where Barman is installed. In that
case, it gathers Barman-related information, as well as system information,
that helps during analysis.

As the user barman, copy the Lasso binary into a folder.

!!! Important
You must run the command as the same user that runs the
Barman process, and you must have enough permission to write in the current
working directory. If you installed Barman using RPM/DEB packages,
Barman is configured to run as the user barman.
!!!

The Barman report is enabled by default if Lasso runs as the barman user
and looks for configuration files in the expected locations, typically `/etc/barman.conf`.
Enter `man 5 barman` for details.

In general, if you installed Barman using EDB-certified RPM and DEB
packages, all you need to do is execute Lasso as the barman user.

### Managing custom installations of Barman

If you have custom installations of Barman, you can enable the barman report
by passing the `--barman` option to Lasso:

```
    ./lasso --barman
```

You can also point to a specific global configuration file by using the `--barman-configuration`
option as follows:

```
    ./lasso --barman-configuration /opt/barman/barman.conf
```

## Replication Manger (repmgr) report

Lasso can run on systems where repmgr is installed. In that
case, it gathers repmgr-related information.

In general, if you installed repmgr using EDB-certified RPM and DEB
packages, all you need to do is execute Lasso.

### How Lasso finds the repmgr configuration file

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the repmgr
configuration file. It uses the first one it finds.

1. Use the one provided through the `--repmgr-configuration` option, if given.
2. Check the paths provided by packages. For example, in CentOS/RHEL packages, the
configuration file is usually put under `/etc/repmgr/<PG_VERSION>/repmgr.conf`.
Lasso inspects those folders, if they exist, in descending order, and uses the
first repmgr configuration file that it finds.
3. Check if a `repmgr.conf` file exists in the current directory.
4. Check if a `/etc/repmgr.conf` file exists.
5. Check the path given by `pg_config --sysconfdir` for the `repmgr.conf` file.
6. Check the output of `systemctl cat <service_name>`, where `<service_name>` is
any service whose name contains `repmgr`, and try to get the `repmgr.conf`
file from the service unit file. It checks the units in descending order, just
as it does in approach 2, and uses the first match.

### Managing custom installations of repmgr

You can point to a specific repmgr configuration file by using the `--repmgr-configuration`
option as follows:

```
    ./lasso --repmgr-configuration /opt/repmgr/repmgr.conf
```

This approach is preferred, as it guarantees Lasso will use
the correct repmgr configuration file instead of trying to find it automatically.

## Postres Enterprise Manager (PEM) report

Lasso can run on systems where PEM is installed. In that
case, it also gathers PEM-related information, like some configuration
files and information about services.

Lasso inspects the well-known paths for configuration files,
as well as well-known service names. If you have custom PEM installations,
Lasso doesn't gather the related information.

## Failover Manager (EFM) report

Lasso can run on systems where EFM is installed. In that
case, it gathers EFM-related information.

In general, if you installed EFM using EDB-certified RPM and DEB
packages, all you need to do is execute Lasso.

### How Lasso finds the EFM configuration file

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the EFM
configuration file. It uses the first one it finds.

1. Use the one provided through the `--efm-configuration` option, if given.
2. Check the paths provided by packages. The configuration file is usually put
under `/etc/edb/efm-<EFM_VERSION>/efm.properties`. Lasso inspects
those folders, if they exist, in descending order, and uses the first EFM
configuration file that it finds.
3. Check the output of `systemctl cat <service_name>`, where `<service_name>` is
replaced with any service whose name starts with `edb-efm-`. Then try to get the
`efm.properties` file from the service unit file. It checks the units in
descending order, just as it does in approach 2, and uses the first match.

### How Lasso finds the EFM binary

Lasso inspects the paths provided by packages. The binary file is
usually put under `/usr/edb/efm-<EFM_VERSION>/bin/efm`. Lasso inspects
these folders, if they exist, in descending order, and uses the first EFM binary
file that it finds.

### Managing custom installations of EFM

You can point to a specific EFM configuration file by using the `--efm-configuration`
option, as follows:

```
    ./lasso --efm-configuration /opt/EFM/efm.properties
```

This approach is preferred, as it guarantees Lasso will use
the correct EFM configuration file instead of trying to find it automatically.

## Replication Server (xDB) report

Lasso can run on systems where xDB is installed. In that
case, it gathers xDB-related information.

In general, if you installed xDB using EDB-certified RPM packages or the
bitrock installer, all you need to do is execute Lasso.

### How Lasso finds the xDB configuration file

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the xDB
configuration files. It uses the first one it finds.

1. Use the ones provided through the `--xdb-pubserver-configuration` and
`--xdb-subserver-configuration` options, if given.
2. Check the paths provided by xDB 7 RPM package and bitrock installer. The
configuration files are usually put under `/etc/edb/xdb/etc`. Lasso
inspects this folder, if it exists, and uses the `xdb_pubserver.conf` and
`xdb_subserver.conf` files found under that folder.
3. Check the paths provided by xDB 6 RPM package and bitrock installer, which are
usually `/usr/ppas-xdb-<XDB_VERSION>/etc` and `/opt/PostgreSQL/EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer/etc`,
respectively. Lasso inspects these folders and, if they exist, uses the
`xdb_pubserver.conf` and `xdb_subserver.conf` files found under the folder. In the
case of RPM packages, as there can be a lot of folders, they're inspected
from newest XDB version to oldest.

### How Lasso finds the xDB binary

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the xDB
binary file. It uses the first one it finds.

1. Check the paths provided by xDB 7 RPM package and bitrock installer. The
binary files are usually put under `/etc/edb/xdb/bin`. Lasso
inspects this folder, if it exists, and uses the `edb-repcli.jar` file found under that
folder.
2. Check the paths provided by the xDB 6 RPM package and bitrock installer, which are
usually `/usr/ppas-xdb-<XDB_VERSION>/bin` and `/opt/PostgreSQL/EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer/bin`,
respectively. Lasso inspects these folders and, if they exist, uses the
`edb-repcli.jar` file found under the folder. In the case of RPM packages, as there
can be a lot of folders, they're inspected from newest XDB version to oldest.

### Managing custom installations of EFM

You can point to a specific xDB publication or subscription server configuration
file by using the `--xdb-pubserver-configuration` and `--xdb-subserver-configuration`
options, as follows:

```
    ./lasso --xdb-pubserver-configuration /opt/xDB/pubserver.conf --xdb-subserver-configuration /opt/xDB/subserver.conf
```

This approach is preferred, as it guarantees Lasso will use
the correct xDB configuration files instead of trying to find it automatically.

## PgBouncer report

Lasso can run on systems where PgBouncer is installed. In that
case, it gathers PgBouncer-related information.

In general, if you installed PgBouncer using EDB-certified RPM and DEB
packages, and PgBouncer instances are up and running, all you need to do is
execute Lasso.

### How Lasso finds the PgBouncer configuration file

Lasso uses the list of running processes to identify the PgBouncer processes
and uses the configuration file retrieved from there.

You can also specify one or more PgBouncer configuration files through
the Lasso argument `--pgbouncer-configuration`. It's mainly useful in scenarios
where a PgBouncer instance isn't running or if Lasso can't
detect the configuration file from the process list.

Lasso collects information from all identified PgBouncer instances.

## HARP report

Lasso can run on systems where HARP is installed. In that
case, it gathers HARP-related information.

In general, if you installed HARP using EDB-certified RPM and DEB
packages, all you need to do is execute Lasso.

### How Lasso finds the HARP configuration file

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the HARP
configuration file. It uses the first one it finds.

1. Use the one provided through the `--harp-configuration` option, if given.
2. Check if the `/etc/harp/config.yml` file exists.

### Managing custom installations of HARP

You can point to a specific HARP configuration file by using the `--harp-configuration`
option, as follows:

```
    ./lasso --harp-configuration /opt/harp/config.yml
```

This approach is preferred, as it guarantees Lasso will use
the correct HARP configuration file instead of trying to find it automatically.

### Running Lasso on a HARP proxy node

The HARP proxy nodes don't have a Postgres or EDB Postgres Advanced Server service running on them, as they're 
intended only as a proxy for connections coming in from the applications.

When using Lasso to gather information from a HARP proxy node, you must use the
`--system-only` option so it doesn't try to connect to the database server.

## etcd report

Lasso can run on systems where etcd is installed. In that
case, it gathers etcd-related information.

### How Lasso finds the etcd configuration file

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the etcd
configuration file. It uses the first one it finds.

1. Use the one provided through `--etcd-configuration` option, if given.
2. Check if the `/etc/etcd/etcd.conf` file exists.


## System-only report

Lasso can also run on systems where Postgres or
Barman aren't installed to gather all relevant information
regarding the underlying operating system.

You can run a system-only report with the following command:

```
    ./lasso --system-only
```
