title: Common considerations

Lasso uses the libpq environment variables to get the
PostgreSQL connection parameters. You can find the list of the environment
variables in the [PostgreSQL
documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-envars.html).

The connection parameters, among other options, can also be passed as command
line arguments:

```

             [--lock-timeout LOCK_TIMEOUT]
             [--statement-timeout STATEMENT_TIMEOUT] [--bindir BINDIR]

                        Describes every single module, in terms of action and
                        output
  --version             Shows Lasso version and modules revision
  --latest-version      Shows the latest available version of EDB Lasso, taken
                        from the EDB Web Services
  --system-only         Gather only system-related information - without
                        requiring a PostgreSQL connection
  --barman              Gather Barman status, enabled by default when Lasso is
                        run as 'barman' user and the executable exists.
                        Defaults to False. When Barman reporting is enabled,
                        we do not gather PostgreSQL related information
  --barman-configuration BARMAN_CONFIGURATION
                        Barman configuration file. By default use the native
                        algorithm in Barman to find the configuration file.
                        Valid only if Barman reporting is enabled
  --repmgr-configuration REPMGR_CONFIGURATION
                        Path to the repmgr.conf file, if using a non-default
                        path
  --efm-configuration EFM_CONFIGURATION
                        Path to the EFM properties file, if using a non-

  --xdb-pubserver-configuration XDB_PUBSERVER_CONFIGURATION
                        Path to the xDB publication server configuration file,
                        if using a non-default path
  --xdb-subserver-configuration XDB_SUBSERVER_CONFIGURATION
                        Path to the xDB subscription server configuration

  --pgbouncer-configuration PGBOUNCER_CONFIGURATION
                        Path to the pgbouncer.ini file. You can specify multiple
                        files separated by comma
  --harp-configuration HARP_CONFIGURATION
                        Path to the config.yml file, if using a non-default
                        path
  --etcd-configuration ETCD_CONFIGURATION
                        Path to the etcd.conf file, if using a non-default

  --upload              Report tarball file is sent to EDB at the end of the
                        execution. The file will be removed if successfully
                        uploaded unless --keep-report is specified
  --keep-report         Keep a local copy of the report even after a
                        successful upload to EDB
  --is-latest-version   Only check if this is the latest available version of
                        Lasso and returns exit code 0 if this is the latest
                        version and 1 otherwise
```

You can also use a configuration file for Lasso, so you can omit most of the
command line options that your environment might require. Lasso looks
for configuration files in the following paths, in this order:

1. `./edb-lasso.cfg` in the same directory where Lasso is running
2. `./edb-lasso.conf` in the same directory where Lasso is running
3. `$HOME/.edb-lasso.conf`
4. `/etc/edb-lasso.conf`

It uses the first match .

A template file for the configuration file looks like this:

```
    ; Lasso template configuration file
    ;
    ; Copyright (C) EnterpriseDB UK Limited 2015-2022 - All Rights Reserved.
    ; Licensed only for use with an EnterpriseDB subscription

    [customer]
    ; the "Company code" from the customer page in the EDB Portal
    id=
    ; the "Token" from the customer page in the EDB Portal
    token=
    ; the depth of the Lasso report. Must be one between: surface, shallow and deep
    depth=deep

    [postgresql]
    ; Lasso uses the following connection string parameters to connect to your
    ; PostgreSQL cluster and take diagnostics. By default it will attempt a peer
    ; connection to socket under directory /var/run/postgresql
    ; dbname=
    ; user=
    ; port=
    ; hostname can be a host or a socket directory
    ; hostname=/var/run/postgresql
    ; password=

    ; session variable to control timeout on lock waits
    ; lock_timeout=3s
    ; session variable to control statement execution time
    ; statement_timeout=5min

    [environment]
    ; PostgreSQL binaries directory. Lasso will try to detect this automatically if
    ; not set
    ; bindir=
    ; if the host is able to access the internet and reach the EDB servers to upload
    ; Lasso reports
    ; external_access=yes

    [barman]
    ; path to barman.conf, if using a non-default one
    ; configuration=

    [repmgr]
    ; path to repmgr.conf, if using a non-default one
    ; configuration=

    [efm]
    ; path to efm.properties, if using a non-default one
    ; configuration=

    [xdb]
    ; path to xdb_pubserver.conf, if using a non-default one
    ; pubserver_configuration=
    ; path to xdb_subserver.conf, if using a non-default one
    ; subserver_configuration=

    [pgbouncer]
    ; path to pgbouncer.ini, if using a non-default one
    ; configuration=

    [harp]
    ; path to config.yml, if using a non-default one
    ; configuration=
```

You can use this template to set up your configuration file. Uncomment 
the desired parameters and set their values according to your
environment.

If you installed Lasso from DEB or RPM packages, You can find that same template configuration
file at `/etc/edb-lasso.conf.templ`.

!!! Important
If you installed Lasso from DEB or RPM packages, then you
must have a configuration file that contains at least the customer
ID and token set. That isn't required if you're running the Lasso disposable
binary, which contains those variables embedded in the binary.
!!!


The script produces a _TAR file_ containing the gathered data.
You must return this file to EDB engineers as part of the process
or send it automatically with the `--upload` option. [^upload]

!!! Important
Some companies have requested for Lasso to
operate in an isolated network. In that case, the `--upload` option isn't
permitted. (You can easily verify this setting from your company page
in the Portal or through the `--version` runtime option.)
To take advantage of this feature, make
sure that the server that's analyzed by Lasso can access the
443 port of any of the front-line websites listed in [Servers accepting upload of reports](96-appendix-a).
!!!

You can also use Lasso on a server that has no
PostgreSQL installation. In that case, use the
`--system-only` option, and the _TAR file_ produced will contain only
system-related information.

## Security considerations

When running queries in the database, Lasso tries to use a role that
has enough privileges to gather the required information from the tool from which
metrics are being gathered.

The following are the tools and the roles that Lasso tries to use for
each of them. Lasso tries to use the first available role in each
tool role list. *Initial connection role* means the role that was provided through
Lasso CLI when running the tool&mdash;usually postgres or enterprisedb.

- PostgreSQL:
    - pg_monitor
    - initial connection role
- PgLogical:
    - pglogical_superuser
    - initial connection role
- PGD:
    - bdr_monitor
    - initial connection role
- PEM:
    - pem_user
    - initial connection role
- repmgr:
    - initial connection role
- xDB:
    - initial connection role

Most of the PGD gatherings try using the bdr_monitor role. However, one of them,
which is in charge of gathering conflicts, tries to use the role
bdr_read_all_conflicts for that purpose. That's the only exception.

In any of the cases, it uses a read-only transaction while querying metrics
and configurations from the database.
