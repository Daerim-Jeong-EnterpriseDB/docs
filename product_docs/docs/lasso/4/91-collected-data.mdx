title: What do we automatically gather in our Lasso report?
---

Our Lasso report is designed to allow any EDB engineer to rapidly
feel the pulse of your database by getting relevant information from your
operating system and your PostgreSQL server.

You can get a list with detailed description of the information that we
automatically gather from your system through `lasso`, by typing:

    $ lasso --describe

If you require further information, do not hesitate to contact your
account manager at EDB.

Lasso informs its level of depth when scraping your system.
There are 3 levels:

* **surface**: non invasive gathering process, mainly used to perform
  a supportability check of the instance, and focused on the current
  moment. In terms of PostgreSQL, the focus is on the instance,
  its configuration, and its general health.
  This is the minimal level of scraping.

* **shallow**: gathering of performance related information, including
  basic trending data. In terms of PostgreSQL data, its focus is
  moved down to the database.
  This is suitable for support incident resolution.

* **deep**: most detailed level of scraping, suitable for advanced
  and security health checks, but also severe support incidents.
  In terms of PostgreSQL data, its focus is on tables and indexes.

Below is a list of gathered data, grouped by context
(Linux, Windows, PostgreSQL, etc.), each reporting the respective depth level.
