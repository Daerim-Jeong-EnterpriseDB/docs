A **Lasso report** is the first step of any evaluation and assessment
process delivered by EDB on existing installations of PostgreSQL
or related tools, including **supportability checks**, **health checks**,
and **incident response investigations**.

It can be generated by the customer, both in an _automated_
and a _supervised_ way.

Some information can be gathered through automated
tools in a non invasive way (phase 1 of the Lasso report).
Some other information cannot be automatically detected
(at least in a non invasive way) and must be communicated by the
customer as part of the Lasso report (phase 2).

Once the gathered information is returned to EDB
engineers (phase 3), EDB will proceed with data analysis,
which will be followed by an offer (in the case of an initial assessment)
or by a final report assessing the status and
the _health_ of your PostgreSQL server (in the case of a health check
service).

!!! Important
Customers must provide EDB with all relevant
information about the underlying system to be checked,
in particular network and hardware configurations.
