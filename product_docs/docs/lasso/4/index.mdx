A *Lasso report* is the first step of any evaluation and assessment
process delivered by EDB on existing installations of PostgreSQL
or related tools, including **supportability checks**, **health checks**,
and **incident response investigations**.

You can generate it both in an _automated_
and in a _supervised_ way.

Some information can be gathered through automated
tools in a noninvasive way, in phase 1 of the Lasso report.
Some other information isn't automatically detected
(at least in a noninvasive way). You must communicate it 
as part of the Lasso report, in phase 2.

After you return the gathered information to EDB
engineers in phase 3, EDB proceeds with data analysis.
Then comes either:

-  An offer, in the case of an initial assessment
-  A final report assessing the status and
the _health_ of your PostgreSQL server, in the case of a health check
service

!!! Important
You must provide EDB with all relevant
information about the underlying system to check,
in particular network and hardware configurations.
