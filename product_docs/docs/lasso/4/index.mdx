EDB has developed a small multi-platform application called Lasso that 
can safely gather relevant diagnostics data on a system where Postgres
and other relevant supported software, such as Barman, is running.

You can also run Lasso on systems where Postgres isn't
installed to gather all relevant information regarding the
underlying operating system.

Consult the specific information for your operating system.

!!! Important
Lasso can't affect your data. It gathers
statistics and diagnostics information from your Postgres server,
with imperceptible effects on the workload. *No actual data* from
the rows of your Postgres user tables is gathered. [^1]
!!!

[^1]: Gathered diagnostics data files are available for your inspection.

Lasso is crucial for Support Operations because it allows EDB's
engineers to have a centralized and standardized source of information
about your system, greatly improving our resolution times and quality of
services.
