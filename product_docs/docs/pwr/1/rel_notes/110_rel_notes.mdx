|       Type        |                                            Description                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature    | Add locking to PWR commands to avoid concurrent runs |
| Change     | Changed the default value for the `assets_dir` config parameter to use the folder where packages place the assets  (`/usr/share/pwr/assets`) |

| Change     | Rework of pwr output and logging |
| Bug Fix    | Fixed RPM package to have a strict dependency on `edb-lasso` >= 4.13.0 |

| Bug Fix    | Fix issues when using timestamp without time zone |
| Bug Fix    | Fix issues related with configuration handling |
| Bug Fix    | Fix issue with `pwr report` failing if `--output-directory` does not exist |
