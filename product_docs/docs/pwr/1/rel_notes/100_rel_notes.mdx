| Feature     | Add `pwr execute` CLI command. The command is used to generate workload reports. While `pwr report` command requires the user to run Lasso and provide its data as input, `pwr execute` takes care of an end-to-end execution, i.e., it runs Lasso and `pwr report` implicitly. The `pwr execute` command requires: edb-lasso (>=4.13.0), edb_wait_states (>=1.2.0). See PWR documentation for more details on the Postgres server requirements as well as for the workload report output formats. |
