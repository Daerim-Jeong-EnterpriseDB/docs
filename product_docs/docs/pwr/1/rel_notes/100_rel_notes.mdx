| Feature     | Added the `pwr execute` CLI command. The command is used to generate workload reports. While `pwr report` command requires that you run Lasso and provide its data as input, `pwr execute` takes care of an end-to-end execution, that is, it runs Lasso and `pwr report` implicitly. The `pwr execute` command requires edb-lasso (>=4.13.0) and edb_wait_states (>=1.2.0). |
| Feature     | Added the `pwr report` CLI command. The `pwr report` command is used to generate workload reports. PWR workload reports can be written in one or more of the following formats: HTML, Markdown, PDF, and DOCX. |
