title: Using EDB SQL Assess
navTitle: Using
---

AssessSQL, the application SQL assessment tool provided by the EDB SQL Assess capability, is a Java-based command-line tool that you can download and install in your local environment. Once installed, it can assess SQL statements provided as an input file. The input file can be an Oracle trace file, an extracted SQL file, or a plain SQL file. To create an Oracle trace file, you can run a test program or regression test suite that performs most of the possible user actions so that all queries get captured in the trace file. To generate an extracted SQL file, you can run the `edb_query_extractor` SQL script.

The tool doesn't provide the ability to help put Oracle in trace mode or retrieve the trace file. Generating and retrieving the trace file from the server, if different from the machine where the tool is being run, are separate operations that you perform manually.

## Generating a SQL trace file

The EDB SQL Assess utility lets you parse Oracle trace files to identify the SQL statements that were executed during an application database session. Once the statements are identified, the utility can assess those statements for their compatibility with EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

!!! Note
   The Oracle user used by the application in the examples is RS4_LIN32.

To generate the trace file for an application:

1. Start the application and let the application connect to the Oracle database server. 

2. Connect to the Oracle database using SQL\*Plus, SQL Developer, or another Oracle client as a user with privileges. With the privileged user, query the `SYS.V$SESSION` and `SYS.V$PROCESS` synonyms and underlying `SYS.V_$SESSION` and `V_$PROCESS` tables, and execute the `DBMS_SYSTEM.SET_SQL_TRACE_IN_SESSION` procedure to initiate a trace.

3. In the Oracle client (for example, SQL\*Plus), execute the query to retrieve the session Id (SID) and serial number for the application connection:

   ```SQL
   SELECT sid, serial#, substr(username, 1, 10), process FROM sys.v_$session WHERE username = 'RS4_LIN32';
   __OUTPUT__

    SID   SERIAL#   SUBSTR(USERNAME,1,10)    PROCESS
   ---- ---------- ------------------------ --------
	16	   6590     RS4_LIN32                35835
   ```
   !!! Tip
      Note the `SID` and `SERIAL#` returned by the query.

4. In the Oracle client, execute the following statement to start a trace:
   
   ```SQL
   EXECUTE dbms_system.set_sql_trace_in_session(16, 6590, true);
   ```

     This statement enables SQL tracing for the session initiated by the application.

   !!! Note
     Depending on the application's database activity, the trace files can become large and impact database resource usage and performance. In operational environments especially, we recommend that you run a trace only for the amount of time required to collect the needed application queries. For more information about the Oracle SQL trace facility and related guidelines on performing application tracing, see the [Oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/tgsql/performing-application-tracing.html#GUID-440D3AD4-B302-408E-8627-FE8032DD09F9).  
   !!!

      (To stop the trace, see step 10.)


5. Run use cases of the application, or run the regression test suite for the application so that the application generates most of the SQL statements.  

6. In the Oracle client, execute the following query to retrieve the SPID, which you can use to identify the trace file generated for the application session:

   ```SQL
   SELECT a.sid, a.serial#, substr(a.username, 1, 10) usr, substr(a.osuser,1,5) osusr, b.spid FROM v$session a, v$process b WHERE a.paddr= b.addr and a.sid=16;
   __OUTPUT__
    SID  SERIAL#    USR               OSUSR       SPID
   ---- ---------- ---------------- ------------ --------
    16   6590       RS4_LIN32        abbas        122523
   ```

   !!! Tip
     Note the SPID returned by the query.


7. In the Oracle client, execute the following query to find the location of the trace file:

   ```SQL
   SELECT physical_path||'/'||physical_file trace_file FROM x$dbgdirext where physical_file like '%\_122523.trc' ESCAPE '\';
   __OUTPUT__
   TRACE_FILE
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   /u01/app/Oracle/diag/diag/rdbms/orcl/ORCL/trace/ORCL_ora_122523.trc
   ```

     When running this query in your environment, replace `122523` with the SPID value returned by the query executed in step 6.

  !!! Note
     Oracle introduced the `V$DIAG_TRACE_FILE` view in Oracle 12c Release 2 that you can query instead of the `X$DBGDIREXT` table. You can use the following query to retrieve the trace file information from the view:
     
     ```SQL
     SELECT adr_home||'/'||trace_filename FROM V$DIAG_TRACE_FILE WHERE trace_filename LIKE '%\_43445.trc' ESCAPE '\';
     ```

     In both queries, a forward slash (`/`) is concatenated onto the trace directory path, which is correct for Linux-based systems. For Windows, replace the forward slash with a backward slash (`\`).

8. Find the trace file returned by the query in the previous step on the database server host machine: 

     In this example, the following is the full path to the file to locate:

   ```text
   /u01/app/Oracle/diag/diag/rdbms/orcl/ORCL/trace/ORCL_ora_122523.trc
   ```

9. Copy the trace file and share it with the migration assessment team.

10. To stop tracing the application session, in the Oracle client, execute the following statement:

   ```SQL
   EXECUTE dbms_system.set_sql_trace_in_session(16, 6590, false);
   ```

## Using the EDB Query Extractor

The EDB Query Extractor is a SQL script to extract queries run by your application from the `V$SQL` system table. You can execute the script using SQL\*Plus. 

The EDB Query Extractor script expects four input parameters:

- Location for output file &mdash; Provide the path where you want the EDB Query Extractor to place the SQL statements extracted from the `V$SQL` table. By default, the trace file generates from the location where SQLPlus was run.

- The name of the user whose queries to extract &mdash; The script extracts the SQL statements run only by the provided Oracle user. By default, the script uses the user who's currently logged in.

- The start timestamp of the queries &mdash; Provide the starting timestamp of the queries to extract in the format DD-MM-YYYY HH24:MI:SS. By default, the script uses `01-01-1970`.

- The end timestamp of the queries &mdash; Provide the ending timestamp of the queries to extract in the format DD-MM-YYYY HH24:MI:SS. By default, the script uses the current time.

This example shows EDB Query Extractor input parameters:

```

## Using plain SQL files

The following are some plain SQL statements that are valid when using the EDB Query Extractor: 

```sql
INSERT INTO PLSQLTEST VALUES ('Hello World');

INSERT INTO PLSQLTEST VALUES (:B1 );

SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB = :B1;

DELETE FROM PLSQLTEST;

BEGIN
PRO_DROP_PRIMARY_KEY('PK_NAME_HERE');

MSCH.INS_LOG_MSG(:msg_number, :msg_proc_id, 'DROP PRIMARY KEY' , :msg_type);
END;
```

## Performing a SQL assessment

After generating the trace files using either the Oracle trace utility or the EDB Query Extractor, you can run the `assessSQL.jar` file using the `runSQLAssess.sh` script to generate a report. The report helps you to identify the compatibility of the application for porting the application to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The tool also generates SQL output files. You can then modify the queries in these output files to be compatible with EDB Postgres Advanced Server syntax.

!!! note
   The suggested query syntax for procedure calls in the generated SQL output files is compatible with executing those calls using JDBC and other languages. For example, suppose the procedure call is:
   
   ```
   begin procin (:1 ); end;      
   ```

   This procedure call is converted to the following call:

   ```
   {CALL procin (? ) }
   ```
       
!!!

### `includeUIDs` parameter

The `includeUIDs` parameter can filter queries from trace files with a comma-separated list of Oracle UID values, like `106, 1120`. The `includeUIDs` parameter doesn't filter queries from exported or plain SQL files. 

For example, if you provide the value `106`, then the queries associated only with UID 106 are assessed. All other queries are discarded. If you don't provide a value for this parameter, by default the assessSQL utility discards queries for `UID=0` and assesses all other queries.

To obtain the UID of an Oracle user, after connecting to the Oracle database as the user, run the following query: 

```sql
SELECT UID FROM DUAL;
```

./runSQLAssess.sh -includeUIDs 109,93 -inputfilepath /home/edb/ -inputfiletype trace -reportpath /home/edb/

## Reviewing EDB SQL Assess reports

EDB SQL Assess divides the features used by application queries into four categories:

- **Compatible features** &mdash; Provides the count of compatible features used in queries.

- **Features with existing available workaround** &mdash; Provides the count of features with known and practical workarounds used in queries.

- **Features with reasonable effort new workaround** &mdash; Provides the count of features where no practical in-database workaround is available and that might require a change in the application architecture.

- **Features with no workaround or requiring further investigation** &mdash; Provides the count of incompatible features for which further investigation is required.

The generated report contains the following tables:

- Overall feature compatibility summary.

- Compatibility summary for each input file.

- Incompatible features for each input file &mdash; Contains a list of incompatible features used by queries in the input file. Also provides the query ID of the query that uses this incompatible feature.

- Incompatible queries for each input file &mdash; Contains a list of all incompatible queries and the incompatible features used in that query.

- Queries with suggested repairs &mdash; Provides two rows per query. The first row contains the original query, and the second row contains the modified query. The incompatible feature that's repaired in the modified query is also provided.
