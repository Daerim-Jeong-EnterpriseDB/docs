navTitle: Troubleshooting

The EDB SQL Assess tool generates a log file in the same path where the report is generated. Provide the path with the command line options. 

The tool supports three log levels:

- If set to `OFF`, then the log isn't generated. 
- If set to `INFO`, then all messages are logged except the queries that are assessed. This is the default.
- If the level is set to `FINE`, then the queries that are assessed are also logged in the file.

## Hostname resolution

To generate reports correctly, EDB SQL Assess needs to resolve the hostname to a valid IP address. If the hostname can't be resolved to a valid IP address, EDB SQL Assess might report an error like the following:

```
myhost: Name or service not known
```
The easiest way to resolve this issue is to add a line like the following in the `/etc/hosts` file:

```
127.0.0.1	myhost
```
## File and folder permissions

Run EDB SQL Assess from a folder where you have permission to create files and folders. Otherwise an error like the following is reported:

```
Cannot create directory 'plte_cache/c75542c1-4763-4ead-a06c-c3534ed2687b'.
```
## Missing queries in EDB Query Extractor output

The EDB Query Extractor extracts queries that are reported through the Oracle `V$SQL` view. The contents of this view will likely change over time, depending on database activity and resources. As a result, the view isn't guaranteed to contain all queries that were executed over a given time period. In addition, Oracle doesn't make certain query types available through the `V$SQL` view, particularly those of a DDL nature.
