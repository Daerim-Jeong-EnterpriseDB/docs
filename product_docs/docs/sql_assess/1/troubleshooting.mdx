navTitle: Troubleshooting

The EDB SQL Assess tool generates a log file in the same path where the report is generated. The path is provided by the user in the command line options. The tool supports three log levels. If set to `OFF` then log is not generated. If set to `INFO`, which is the default, then all messages are logged except the queries that are assessed. If the level is set to `FINE` then the queries that are assessed are also logged in the file.

To generate reports correctly, EDB SQL Assess needs to resolve the `hostname` to a valid IP address. The easiest way is to add a line like the following in the `/etc/hosts` file:

```
127.0.0.1	myhost
```

If the `hostname` can't be resolved to a valid IP address, EDB SQL Assess might report an error like the following:

```
myhost: Name or service not known
```

You can run EDB SQL Assess from a folder where the user has permission to create files and folders, otherwise an error like the following is reported:

```
Cannot create directory 'plte_cache/c75542c1-4763-4ead-a06c-c3534ed2687b'.
```

!!! Note
    EDB Query Extractor sometimes fails to extract all the queries to the provided output file.
