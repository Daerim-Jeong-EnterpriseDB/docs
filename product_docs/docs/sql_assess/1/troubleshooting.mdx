navTitle: Troubleshooting

The EDB SQL Assess tool generates a log file in the same path where the report is generated. The path is provided by the user in the command line options. The tool supports three log levels. If set to `OFF` then log is not generated. If set to `INFO`, which is the default, then all messages are logged except the queries that are assessed. If the level is set to `FINE` then the queries that are assessed are also logged in the file.

## Hostname resolution
To generate reports correctly, EDB SQL Assess needs to resolve the `hostname` to a valid IP address. If the `hostname` can't be resolved to a valid IP address, EDB SQL Assess might report an error like the following:

```
myhost: Name or service not known
```
The easiest way is to add a line like the following in the `/etc/hosts` file:

```
127.0.0.1	myhost
```
## File and folder permissions
You must run EDB SQL Assess from a folder where the user has permission to create files and folders, otherwise an error like the following is reported:

```
Cannot create directory 'plte_cache/c75542c1-4763-4ead-a06c-c3534ed2687b'.
```
## Missing queries in EDB Query Extractor output
The EDB Query Extractor extracts queries that are reported by the Oracle `V$SQL` view.  This contents of this view will likely change over time depending on database activity and resource.  As a result, it is not guaranteed to contain all queries that may have been exectued over a given time period.  In addition, Oracle does not make certain query types, particularly of a DDL nature, available through the `V$SQL` view.
