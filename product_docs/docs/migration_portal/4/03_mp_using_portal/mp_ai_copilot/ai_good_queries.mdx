title: How to create good queries 

---

The quality and accuracy of the answers the AI Copilot provides depends highly on your query or prompt. 
The more detailed and precise you can make your prompt, the better answers you will obtain. 

Like with other language models, you can use prompt engineering techniques with the AI Copilot to improve your query input. 

## Data considerations 

All prompts inserted in the chatbox are stored in an EDB-managed backend database with the purpose of analyzing and improving the tool. 
Data is also stored by Microsoft Azure's OpenAI.

Don't enter sensitive information like full names, user names, passwords, addresses, etc. into the chatbox. 

## Example queries 

Before applying any suggested solutions in production environments, 
we strongly recommend testing the solutions in a controlled test environment 
to ensure the proposed fixes align with your specific migration requirements.
