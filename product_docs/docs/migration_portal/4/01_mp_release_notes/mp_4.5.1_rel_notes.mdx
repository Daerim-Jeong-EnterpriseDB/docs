New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Migration Portal 4.5 include the following:

| Type | Description |

| Bug fix | Fixed an issue where the assessment phase gets stuck due to over-utilization of memory when processing a large size script that contains many thousands of tables. |
| Bug fix | Fixed the issue where the assessment fails when the **Add suffix to make object names unique** option is selected and the database object contains the `$` character as part of its name. |

## End-of-support notice
Since the end of standard support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) version 11 is scheduled for November 20, 2023, select more recent versions of EPAS that are supported beyond 2023 for new Migration Portal projects.  Support for EPAS 11 is planned to begin being removed from Migration Portal on May 20, 2023 to help ensure that no new EPAS 11 projects are created after this date. 

To maximize the length of available support and to take advantage of new features, particularly those that provide additional compatibility with Oracle, we recommend selecting the latest EPAS version as the target of a Migration Portal project. See the EDB [Platform Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas) page for more information on the support periods for each EDB Postgres Advanced Server major version.
