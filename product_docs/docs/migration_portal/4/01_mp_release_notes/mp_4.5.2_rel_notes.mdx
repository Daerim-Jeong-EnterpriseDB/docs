Released: 

New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Migration Portal 4.6.0 include the following:

| Type        | Description |
| ----------- |------------ |
| Enhancement | Improved performance of the schema parsing phase for large schema files that contain a large number of Oracle objects. |
| Enhancement | Migration Portal now supports the assessment and migration of the `DEFAULT` profile. |
| Enhancement | A new repair handler (ERH-2104) has been added that replaces `XMLTable` with `XMLParse` if the `XMLTable` call has a single argument. |
| Enhancement | A new repair handler (ERH-2105) has been added that encloses parentheses around the value of the `IN` clause inside `SELECT` statements. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the ERH-2030 repair handler issue where the NEW and OLD variable name references in the `REFERENCING` clause updated by the repair handler were not correspondingly updated in the `WHEN` clause of the trigger definition. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the ERH-2065 repair handler to remove the `NO INMEMORY` clause from the `SUBPARTITION TEMPLATE` clause. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the ERH-2002 repair handler issue where it was not being applied in some scenarios. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the ERH-2009 repair handler issue where it was not being applied in some scenarios. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue where the occurrence of the `UTL_HTTP.END_OF_BODY` exception inside PL/SQL objects was not handled in the parsing phase. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue where `GRANT EXECUTE ON DIRECTORY` statements were not getting removed from the uploaded source DDL scripts. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue where the `XMLRoot` function was incorrectly flagged as incompatible although it is supported in EDB Postgres Advanced Server. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue where an assessment fails because of an `OutOfMemoryError` exception in some scenarios. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed parsing issues related to the usage of the `REMARK`, `HOST` and `PROMPT` keywords in schema files. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue where column names inside check constraints were not getting double-quoted when the **Use Oracle's default case for schema migration** option was selected for the project. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the EDB DDL Extractor script so that it performs the permission check  prior to performing the Oracle version check and actual schema extraction. |
| Bug Fix | Updated the DDL parser to comment out `GRANT RESOURCE` statements generated for roles without a schema. |

## End-of-support notice ##
Since the end of standard support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 11 is scheduled for November 20, 2023, select more recent versions of EDB Postgres Advanced Server that are supported beyond 2023 for new Migration Portal projects. Support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11 was removed from Migration Portal on May 20, 2023 to help ensure that no new EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11 projects are created after this date.

To maximize the length of available support and to take advantage of new features, particularly those that provide added compatibility with Oracle, we recommend selecting the latest EDB Postgres Advanced Server version as the target of a Migration Portal project. See the EDB Platform Compatibility page for more information on the support periods for each EDB Postgres Advanced Server major version.
