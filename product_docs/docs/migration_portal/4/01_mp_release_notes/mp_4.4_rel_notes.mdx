New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Migration Portal 4.4 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | The Migration Portal now supports EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 15, the latest major version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server. |
| Enhancement | The Migration Portal has been enhanced to provide the option to preserve the Oracle default case for object names in a migration project.  In Postgres, the default case for object names is lowercase.  In Oracle, it is uppercase.  In most cases, the Postgres default case should be used when migrating a database to Postgres; however, this new option is being provided to better support those applications that specifically use quoted uppercase identifiers in their database queries.  Note that while the new capability enables all objects to be created with quoted uppercase names, the initial implementation does not update object name references specified in procedural code. |
| Enhancement | The Migration Portal migration complexity and feature analysis capability has been enhanced to capture and report the presence of certain Oracle features that had previously not been captured, including the `OUTER JOIN WITH BETWEEN` feature, which corresponds to the use of a `BETWEEN` clause as a condition of an outer join in a query. |
| Enhancement | Migration Portal has been enhanced with a new Repair Handler ERH-3008 which removes `CONSTRAINT` clause(s) from `CREATE VIEW` definition because EDB Postgres Advanced Server does not support it. As part of this enhancement, a new feature `'VIEW COLUMN CONSTRAINT'` with Features with existing available workaround category is added in the Feature Analysis section. |
| Enhancement | An existing Repair Handler ERH-2057 is now enhanced to remove the precision part from `LONG` data type. |
| Bug fix | The EDB DDL Extractor has been updated to extract `ROLE` to `ROLE` grants that were not previously being fetched. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue where the DDL for a `VIEW` was being truncated after the `DATE` keyword, when used to specify a date literal. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue that resulted in the removal of the `DEFAULT` clause on table columns that are specified with `EXTENDED` as the column name. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue where an incorrect object count was being shown in the assessment report, after a user manually repairs an object. |
| Bug fix | While converting `PIPE ROW` syntax to `RETURN NEXT` syntax, the Repair Handler ERH-2059 was not able to detect schema name prefix to the `TYPE` name. The Repair Handler is now corrected to remove the schema name prefix. |
| Other | The `TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ()` function with single argument is not supported in EDB Postgres Advanced Server. A KB article is added with a proposed work-around. |
| Other | Support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 10 has been removed. Users can no longer select EDB Postgres Advanced Server 10 as a target database for new migration projects.  Users are also no longer able to upload new schemas and edit and reassess objects in existing EDB Postgres Advanced Server 10 projects.  |
