|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement       | A new repair handler (ERH-2106) was added that removes the `VARRAY` property column clause from the `CREATE TABLE` statement as EDB Postgres Advanced Server does not support the `VARRAY` column property. |
| Enhancement       | A new repair handler (ERH-2107) was added that removes the `USING INDEX COMPUTE STATISTICS` cause from the `CREATE TABLE` statement as EDB Postgres Advanced Server does not support it.                    |
| Security&nbsp;fix | Updated the PostgreSQL JDBC library used by Migration Portal to address the security vulnerabilities identified in [CVE-2024-1597](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1597).                         |
| Bug&nbsp;fix      | Fixed an issue that led to parsing failures for large DDLs that had led to skipping of words from source DDL.                                                                                               |
| Bug&nbsp;fix      | Fixed an issue where DDL files containing special Unicode characters caused the assessment to fail and the user not being able to see any projects.                                                         |
