| Feature      | Added a new AI Copilot feature that you can use to ask questions related to database migrations and request suggestions to resolve specific Oracle to EPAS schema incompatibility issues. Consult the [Migration Portal AI Copilot documentation](/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/mp_ai_copilot/) for more information. |
| Enhancement  | Added a new repair handler ERH-2108 that removes the `PARALLEL/NOPARALLEL` clause from `PARTITIONED TABLE` and `MVIEW` definitions as it is not supported in EPAS.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where Migration Portal was not able to remove the `XMLTYPE` column property clause, which is not supported in EPAS, from the `TABLE` definition.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where an end portion of DDL files was removed due to a parsing failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
