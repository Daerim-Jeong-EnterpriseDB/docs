navTitle: "Setting agent privileges"

By default, the PEM agent is installed with root privileges for the operating system host and superuser privileges for the database server. These privileges allow the PEM agent to invoke unrestricted probes on the monitored host and database server about system usage, retrieving and returning the information to the PEM server.

## Root user versus non-root user

PEM functionality lessens as the privileges of the PEM agent decrease. For complete functionality, run the PEM agent as root. If the PEM agent is run under the database server's service account, PEM probes don't have complete access to the statistical information used to generate reports, and functionality is limited to the capabilities of that account. If the PEM agent is run under another lesser-privileged account, functionality is limited even further.

## Error handling

If the probe is querying the operating system without enough privileges, the probe might return a `permission denied` error. If the probe is querying the database without enough privileges, the probe might return a `permission denied` error or display the returned data in a PEM chart or graph as an empty value.

When a probe fails, an entry is written to the log file that contains the name of the probe, the reason the probe failed, and a hint that helps you resolve the problem.

You can view probe-related errors that occurred on the server in the Probe Log dashboard or review error messages in the PEM worker log files. On Linux, the default location of the log file is:

 `/var/log/pem/worker.log`

On Windows, log information is available on the Event Viewer.
