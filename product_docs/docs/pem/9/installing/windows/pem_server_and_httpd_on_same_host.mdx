The easiest PEM server installation configuration consists of a PEM backend database server (hosted on a PostgreSQL database installed with the PEM server installer) and a PEM-HTTPD service that reside on the same host. In this configuration, the PEM server installer provides the prerequisite software for the backend host to register the service (on Windows).




EDB provides a graphical interactive installer for Windows. You can access it two ways:

- Download the graphical installer from the [Downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres#pem) and invoke the installer directly. See [Installing directly](/eprs/latest/installing/windows/#installing-directly).

- Use Stack Builder (with PostgreSQL) or StackBuilder Plus (with EDB Postgres Advanced Server) to download the EDB installer package and invoke the graphical installer.  See [Using Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus](/eprs/latest/installing/windows/#using-stack-builder-or-stackbuilder-plus).

## Installing directly

After downloading the graphical installer, to start the installation wizard, assume sufficient privileges (superuser or administrator) and double-click the installer icon. If prompted, provide a password.

In some versions of Windows, to invoke the installer with Administrator privileges, you need to right-click on the installer icon and select **Run as Administrator** from the context menu.

Proceed to the [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer) section.

## Using Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus

If you are using PostgreSQL, you can invoke the graphical installer with Stack Builder. See [Using Stack Builder](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/03_using_stackbuilder/). 

1. In Stack Builder, follow the prompts until you get to the module selection page.

1. Expand the **Registration-required and trial products** node. 

1. Expand the **EnterpriseDB Tools** node and select **Postgres Enterprise Manager Server**. 

1. Proceed to the [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer) section in this topic.

If you are using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you can invoke the graphical installer with StackBuilder Plus. See [Using StackBuilder Plus](/epas/latest/epas_inst_windows/installing_advanced_server_with_the_interactive_installer/using_stackbuilder_plus/). 

1. In StackBuilder Plus, follow the prompts until you get to the module selection page. 

1. Expand the **EnterpriseDB Tools** node and select **Postgres Enterprise Manager Server**. 

1. Proceed to the [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer) section in this topic.

## Using the graphical installer 

1. On the Setup PEM Server page, select **Next**.

1. Read the license agreement. If you accept the agreement, select **I accept the agreement** and select **Next**.

1. Browse to a directory where you want the PEM Server to be installed, or allow the installer to install it in the default location. Select **Next**.

   The PEM server installer performs a preinstallation check for PEM-HTTPD, Language Pack, and PostgreSQL 13. If the installer doesn't locate these packages, it informs you in the Dependency Missing dialog box.

   !!! Note
       By default EDB Language Pack is installed in `C:\edb\languagepack\v1`.

1. If dependencies are missing, the PEM server installer launches installers for the missing dependencies. Follow the onscreen directions each package.

   After installing any missing dependencies, the installation process continues by displaying the Database Server Installation Details dialog box. The information provided on the Database Server Installation Details dialog box enables the installer to connect to the PostgreSQL server. 

1. Provide the user name and password of a database superuser. After supplying the requested information, select **Next**.

1. After providing the name and password of the Postgres database superuser, you might be prompted for the password to the user account under which the PEM agent will run. If prompted, provide the password, and select **Next**.

1. On the Network Details page specify the CIDR-style network address from which the PEM agents will connect to the server (the *client-side* address).

   You can specify the address of a network host or a network address range. For example, if you want to monitor database servers with the addresses `192.168.10.23`, `192.168.10.76`, and `192.168.10.184`, enter `192.168.10.0/24` to allow connections with hosts in that network.

   The specified address is added to the server's `pg_hba.conf` file. You can specify more network addresses by manually adding entries to the `pg_hba.conf` file on the PostgreSQL server. Use the first entry as a template.

   After you add the network address, select **Next**.

   The PEM server installer installs a PEM agent on the host where the server resides to monitor the server and provide alert processing and garbage collection services. A certificate is also installed in the location specified in the **Agent certificate path** field.

1. Enter an alternate description or select an alternate agent certificate path for the PEM agent, or accept the defaults. Select **Next**.

1. On the Ready to Install page, select **Next**.

   An information box shows the installation progress of the selected components. This may take a few minutes.

   During the installation process, the installer copies files to the system and sets up the database and web services required to run PEM. When the installation completes, a confirmation indicates that:
   -  The web service was configured.
   -  The web service is listening on port 8443.
   -  The `pem` database was created and configured.

1.  Select **Finish**.
