You may install PEM on a single server, or you may install the web application server and the backend database on two separate servers. This page explains how to prepare your server(s) for PEM installation. 

After completing these steps you must follow the instructions to [install](/pem/latest/installing/linux_x86_64/index.mdx) and [configure](/pem/8/installing/configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux.mdx) PEM. If you are using two servers, you must complete the installation and configuration steps on both servers.


To install a Postgres Enterprise Manager server on Linux, you need to perform some preliminary configuration:
    
1.  Install a [supported Postgres instance](/pem/latest/index/#postgres-compatibility) for PEM to use as a backend database.You may install this instance on the same server as you will use for the PEM web application, or a separate server. You may also use an existing Postgres instance providing the conditions below are met.

2.  Configure authentication on the Postgres backend database by updating the `pg_hba.conf` file. 
    
Further changes will be made to this file automatically during [configuration](/pem/latest/installing/configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux.mdx) but the changes detailed here must be made manually, prior to configuration.
  
    - The PEM configuration script connects to the Postgres backend database as a superuser of your choice using password authentication in order to create the relations required for PEM. This requires you to permit your chosen superuser to authenticate using a password. This user must be able to connect from any location in which you will run the configuration script. In practice, this means the server on which the backend database is located, and the server on which the PEM web application is to be installed if this is different.

    - To allow the chosen superuser to connect using password authentication, add a line `pg_hba.conf` that allows `host` connections using `md5` or `scram-sha-256` authentication, for example `host all superusername 127.0.0.1/32 scram-sha-256`.

    !!! Note
    If you're using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, see [Modifying the pg_hba.conf file](/pem/latest/managing_database_server/#modifying-the-pg_hbaconf-file).

    If you're using PostgreSQL, see [Client Authentication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

3.  Verify that the `sslutils` extension is installed on your Postgres server. 
    If you are using PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Extended Server on RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux or SLES, you will also need to install the `hstore contrib` module.

    -   If you're using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you can install the `sslutils` extension as follows, where `<x>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced server version.

        For RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux 8/9:
          
        ```shell
        dnf install edb-as<x>-server-sslutils
        ```

        For RHEL/OL/CentOS 7:
          
        ```shell
        yum install edb-as<x>-server-sslutils
        ```

        For Debian/Ubuntu:
          
        ```shell
        apt install edb-as<x>-server-sslutils
        ```

        For SLES:
          
        ```shell
        zypper install edb-as<x>-server-sslutils
        ```

    -   If you're using PostgreSQL, you can install the `sslutils` and (if required) `hstore` modules as follows, where `<x>` is the PostgreSQL version.: 

        For RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux 8/9:
          
        ```shell
        dnf install sslutils_<x> postgresql<x>-contrib
        ```

        For RHEL/OL/CentOS 7:
          
        ```shell
        yum install sslutils_<x> postgresql<x>-contrib
        ```

        For Debian/Ubuntu:
          
        ```shell
        apt install postgresql-<x>-sslutils
        ```

        For SLES:
          
        ```shell
        zypper install sslutils_<x> postgresql<x>-contrib
    
    -   If you're using EDB Postgres Extended Server, you can install the `sslutils` and (if required) `hstore` modules as follows, where `<x>` is the EDB Postgres Extended Server version.: 

        For RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux 8/9:
          
        ```shell
        dnf install edb-postgresextended<x>-sslutils edb-postgresextended<x>-contrib
        ```

        For RHEL/OL/CentOS 7:
          
        ```shell
        yum install edb-postgresextended<x>-sslutils edb-postgresextended<x>-contrib
        ```

        For Debian/Ubuntu:
          
        ```shell
        apt install edb-postgresextended-sslutils-<x>
        ```

        For SLES:
          
        ```shell
        zypper install edb-postgresextended<x>-sslutils edb-postgresextended<x>-contrib
        ```

    !!! Note For Debian and Ubuntu users               
        Debian 10 and Ubuntu 20 changed the requirements for accepting certificates.

          -   If you want to install the PEM agent on a machine with an old version of sslutils, then you must upgrade sslutils to 1.3. Version 1.3 has a 4096-bit RSA key and sha256 signature algorithm support added to it.
          -   If you don't upgrade sslutils to 1.3, then PEM agent might fail to connect to the PEM backend database server, and it might log the error "ca md too weak."

4. If you're using a firewall, allow access to port 8443 on the server where the PEM web application will be located:

     For RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux/OL/CentOS/SLES:

    ```shell
    firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8443/tcp
         
    firewall-cmd --reload
    ```
       
    For Debian/Ubuntu:

    ```shell
    iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p TCP --dport 8443 -j ACCEPT
    ```

5. Make sure the components Postgres Enterprise Manager depends on, such as python3, libboost, openssl (1.0.2k or later), snmp++, and libcurl, are up to date on all servers: 

     For RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux 8:

     ```shell
     dnf upgrade
     ```

     For RHEL/OL/CentOS 7:
   
     ```shell
    yum upgrade
    ```

    For Debian/Ubuntu:
   
    ```shell
    apt-get update
    ```

    For SLES:
   
   ```shell
   zypper update
   ```

## Supported locales

Currently, the Postgres Enterprise Manager server and web interface support a locale of `English(US) en_US` and use of a period (.) as a language separator character. Using an alternate locale or a separator character other than a period might cause errors.
