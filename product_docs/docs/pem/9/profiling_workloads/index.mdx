Most RDBMS experts agree that inefficient SQL code is the leading cause of most database performance problems. The challenge for DBAs and developers is to locate that SQL code in large and complex systems and then optimize that code for better performance.

The following extensions are available to profile the workloads:

-   [SQL Profiler](pem_sqlprofiler) &mdash; allows a database superuser to locate and optimize inefficient SQL code 
-   [Index Advisor](index_advisor) &mdash; works with SQL Profiler by examining collected SQL statements and making indexing recommendations for any underlying tables to improve SQL response time
