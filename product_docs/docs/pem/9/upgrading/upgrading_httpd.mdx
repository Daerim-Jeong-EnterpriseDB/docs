The Apache HTTPD web server is used to serve the PEM web application. 
On Linux, PEM does not bundle HTTPD, but depends on the version provided by the system package manager. 
On Windows the PEM installer bundles a version of HTTPD.

## Upgrading HTTPD on Linux

!!! Important
    If you are using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Rocky, Alma, or Oracle Linux, and seeking to update HTTPD in order to address a vulnerability,
    please read [Note on HTTPD versioning in RHEL and RHEL-like distros](#note-on-httpd-versioning-in-rhel-and-rhel-like-distros), below.

If you are running Linux, HTTPD should be managed along with other system software on your servers. 
We recommend always using the latest version available from your package manager.

You do not need to stop PEM or back up any files prior to upgrade, simply initiate the upgrade from your package manager.

#### RHEL / Rocky Linux / AlmaLinux / Oracle Linux
```bash
sudo yum update httpd
```

#### Debian / Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade apache2
```

#### SLES
```bash
sudo zypper update apache2
```

### Note on HTTPD versioning in RHEL and RHEL-like distros
You may notice that the latest version of HTTPD available from Red Hat (or other distributions that re-package Red Hat RPMs) has a significantly older version number than the latest community release.
Specifically, RHEL 7 provides HTTPD 2.4.6 and RHEL 8 provides 2.4.37. It is very important to understand that Red Hat builds custom HTTPD packages for RHEL and backports security fixes. 
For this reason, you should not assume that a vulnerability present in the community 2.4.37 release is present in the RHEL package of the same version. 
If you are trying to install a newer version of HTTPD for this reason, it is almost certainly not necessary. Please see [this Red Hat article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/445713) for more information.

!!! Warning
    Neither community HTTPD nor HTTPD built from source is supported by Red Hat. 
    If you are considering using any other source of HTTPD on a RHEL system please read the article linked above and ensure you understand the implications.

## Upgrading HTTPD on Windows

To upgrade to the latest version of HTTPD packaged for PEM by EDB, you should download the latest PostgreSQL or EDB Advanced Server installer for Windows and use
 [Stack Builder](/supported-open-source/postgresql/installing/using_stackbuilder/)
or [StackBuilder Plus](/epas/latest/installing/windows/installing_advanced_server_with_the_interactive_installer/using_stackbuilder_plus/) respectively to update PEM-HTTPD.
PEM-HTTPD is located under the 'Web Development' category.
