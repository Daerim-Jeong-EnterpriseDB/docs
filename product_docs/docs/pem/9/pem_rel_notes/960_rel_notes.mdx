| Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement  | Added an option to enable probes using the pemworker utility.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Enhancement  | PEM now includes the error message in email notifications of a failed job. The default character limit for error output is 1000, which can be configured now using `job_notification_error_limit` parameter in the server configuration. |
| Enhancement  | Added two alert templates &mdash; `Inactive replication slots` and `Conflicting replication slots` and added two probes &mdash; `Replication slots` and `Multixact ID Exhaustion (Wraparound)`.                                                                                                |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where audit manager was setting `edb_audit_statement` parameter to '' instead on 'none' when log statement parameter was left empty in the GUI resulting in failure of server restart.                                               |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Updated the default parameter for configuring PEM to use the `Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)` hostname while agent registration.                                                                                                                |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue with error `NoneType` has no `len()` when alerts were listed on the alert dashboard.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue for team role feature for the PEM agents.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue with SQL query for the PEM agent registration. Added the public schema name in the table prefix to execute the SQL query successfully even if schema name is not in the search path.                                                 |
| Big&nbsp;fix | Updated the alert template `Table size in server/database/schema` with more detailed SQL query.                                                                                                                                                     |
