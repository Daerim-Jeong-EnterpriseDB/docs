## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Log in as a superuser:

  ```shell
  sudo su -
  ```

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the screen instructions.

  Instructions for installing the package are also available from the repository. If you need additional information about running the install command or initial configuration, refer back to this topic.

## Install the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-pem-agent
```

After installing PEM agent, you need to register the PEM agent. For detailed information see [Registering an agent](/pem/latest/registering_agent/).
