navTitle: Debian 10
title: Installing Postgres Enterprise Manager agent on Debian 10 x86_64
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Address other prerequisites

  ```shell
  #  Add support for secure APT repositories:
  sudo apt-get -y install apt-transport-https

  #  Add the EDB signing key. Substitute your EnterpriseDB credentials
  #  for the '<USERNAME>' and '<PASSWORD>' placeholders.
  wget -q -O - https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key  | sudo apt-key add -

  #  Update the repository metadata:
  sudo apt-get update
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo apt-get install edb-pem-agent
```

After installing PEM agent, you need to register the PEM agent. For detailed information see [Registering an agent](/pem/latest/registering_agent/).
