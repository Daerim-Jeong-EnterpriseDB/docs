---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Other prerequisites

```shell
#  Install the EPEL repository:
sudo dnf -y install epel-release


#  Enable additional repositories to resolve dependencies:
sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools

#  Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:
sudo dnf -qy module disable postgresql
```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-pem-agent
```

After installing PEM agent, you need to register the PEM agent. For detailed information see [Registering an agent](/pem/latest/registering_agent/).
