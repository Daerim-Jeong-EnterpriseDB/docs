!!! Note

    Postgres Enterprise Manager 8.3 and later is supported on SLES.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.
  To determine if your repository exists, enter this command: `dnf repolist | grep enterprisedb`

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).
  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repo. Depending on your subscription level, you may be able to access two generations of EDB repos. EDB Repos 2.0 provides the most recent instructions.
  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

  Alternatively, you can set up the PostgreSQL community repository instead of the EDB repository. To set up the PostgreSQL community repository, go to [yum](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/) or [apt](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt).

- Activate the required SUSE module

  ```shell
  # You can use SLES 15 SP3 for PEM 8.3 and later:
  sudo SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.3/x86_64

  # You can use SLES 15 SP4 for PEM 8.6 and later:
  sudo SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.4/x86_64

  ```

- Refresh the metadata
  ```shell
  sudo zypper refresh
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo zypper -n install edb-pem-agent
```

After installing PEM agent, you need to register the PEM agent. For detailed information see [Registering an agent](../../registering_agent/).
