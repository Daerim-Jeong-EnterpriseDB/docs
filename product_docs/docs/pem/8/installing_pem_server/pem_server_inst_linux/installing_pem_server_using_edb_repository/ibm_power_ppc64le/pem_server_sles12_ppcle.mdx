## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Review the [prerequisites](/pem/latest/installing_pem_server/pem_server_inst_linux/prerequisites/).

- Log in as a superuser:

  ```shell
  sudo su -
  ```

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the screen instructions.

  Instructions for installing the package are also available from the repository. If you need additional information about running the install command or initial configuration, refer back to this topic.

## Install the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-pem
```

## Initial configuration

```shell
# You can configure the PEM server using the following command:
/usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh
```

For more details, see [Configuring the PEM Server on Linux](/pem/latest/installing_pem_server/installing_on_linux/configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux/).

!!! Note

- The operating system user pem is created while installing the PEM server. The PEM server web application is a WSGI application, which runs under Apache HTTPD. The pem application data and the session is saved to this user's home directory.
