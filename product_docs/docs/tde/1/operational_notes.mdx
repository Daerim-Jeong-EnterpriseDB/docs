A physical replica is necessarily encrypted (or not encrypted) in the same way and using the same keys as its primary server. If a server uses TDE, a base backup is automatically encrypted. Any WAL fetched from a server using TDE, including streaming replication and archiving, is encrypted.

Logical replication is not affected by TDE. Publisher and subscriber can have different encryption settings. The payload of the logical replication protocol is not encrypted. (Of course, SSL can be used.)
