This section contains details about the cryptographic methods used by the transparent data encryption feature.

The data files are encrypted using AES-128-XTS. The XTS “tweak” uses the database OID, the relfilenode, and the block number.

The WAL is encrypted using AES-128-CTR. The “counter” includes the WAL LSN.

Temporary files that are accessed by block are also encrypted using AES-128-XTS. Other temporary files are encrypted using AES-128-CBC.
