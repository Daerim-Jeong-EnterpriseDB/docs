Specifically, TDE encrypts:

- The files underlying tables, sequences, indexes, including TOAST tables and system catalogs, and including all forks. (We shall call these the “data files” below.)

- The write-ahead log (WAL).

- Various temporary files that are used during query processing and the operation of the database system.

The following are not encrypted or otherwise disguised by TDE:

- Metadata internal to the operation of the database system that does not contain user data, such as the transaction status (e.g., pg_subtrans, pg_xact).

- The file names and file system structure in the data directory. (That means, the overall size of the database system, the number of databases, the number of tables, their relative sizes, as well as file-system metadata such as last access time are all visible without decryption.)

- Data in foreign tables.

- The server diagnostics log.

- Configuration files.

Transparent data encryption can be enabled when a database cluster is initialized using [initdb](/initdb); see there for details.
