TDE-specific file locations:

## File locations

| Option | Description | 
| ------- | ---------- |
| data_encryption_key_unwrap_command (*string*) | <p> Specifies a command to unwrap (decrypt) the data encryption key. The command should contain a placeholder *`%p`*, which will be replaced by the name of the file containing the key to unwrap. The command must print the unwrapped (decrypted) key to its standard output. If this is not specified, the environment variable `PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD` is used. An empty string means to not apply any key unwrapping command. Specifying this option or the environment variable fallback is required if data encryption is used. See [Key management](/tde/latest/#key-management) for more information. This parameter can only be set at server start. </p> This parameter is normally initialized by `initdb` and doesn't need to be changed unless the key wrap method is changed.
