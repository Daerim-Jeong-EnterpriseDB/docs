title: "Differences in TDE-enabled systems"

## Limitations TDE imposes on standard Postgres functionality

If transparent data encryption is enabled, the `FILE_COPY` strategy cannot be used in `strategy` parameter with `create database`. See [PostgreSQL CREATE DATABASE documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-createdatabase.html) for more information.

## Processes affected by TDE

When TDE is enabled:

- You need to decrypt WAL files before using them for troubleshooting
  - [pg_waldump]() 
  - [pg_resetwal]()
- You need to decrypt backup files before verifying or resynchronizing them
  - [pg_verifybackup]
  - [pg_rewind]
Upgrade


- [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/app-postgres.html) - The PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD environment variable 
- wal files - you can encrypt WAL files

- backups - if the backup is of encrypted database, you can decrypt the backup files


- pg_upgrade - upgrading the encrypted database cluster
