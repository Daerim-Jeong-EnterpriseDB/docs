title: "Write ahead logs (WAL)"

## pg_waldump
Use these TDE options with `initdb -y`:

### Options

| Option | Description | 
| ------- | ---------- |
| --data-encryption | Consider the WAL files to be encrypted and decrypt them before processing them. This must be specified if the WAL files have been encrypted by transparent data encryption. pg_waldump cannot automatically detect whether WAL files are encrypted. |
| --key-file-name=*file* | Load the data encryption key from the given location.
| --key-unwrap-command=*command* | Specifies a command to unwrap (decrypt) the data encryption key. The command should include a placeholder ``%p`` that specifies the file to read the wrapped key from. The command needs to write the unwrapped key to its standard output. If this is not specified, the environment variable ``PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD`` is used. An empty string means to not apply any key unwrapping command. Specifying this option or the environment variable fallback is required if data encryption is used. See [Key management](/tde/latest/#key-management) for further information. |


### Environment

The ``PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD`` specifies the default for the option --key-unwrap-command.
