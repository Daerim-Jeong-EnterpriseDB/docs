  Instructions for installing the package are also available from the repository. If you need additional information about running the install command or initial configuration, refer back to this topic.

## Install the package

```shell
yum -y install edb-as14-hdfs_fdw
```

Where `14` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Replace `14` with the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server you are using.
