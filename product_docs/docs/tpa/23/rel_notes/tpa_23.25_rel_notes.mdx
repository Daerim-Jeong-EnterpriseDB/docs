navTitle: "Version 23.25"

Released: 14 Nov 2023

New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Trusted Postgres Architect 23.25 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | TPA now supports automated upgrades from PGD 3.7 to PGD 5.3 or above. |
| Enhancement | TPA now supports EDB Advanced Server 16 and EDB Extended Server 16. |
| Change | Various improvements to the upgrade process introduced with PGD 4 to PGD 5 upgrades have been backported to BDR-Always-ON upgrades. |
| Change | TPA now supports installing PEM on SLES. |
| Change | TPA now explicitly sets permissions when creating some filesystem objects. This will be extended to all filesystem objects in a future release. |
| Change | TPA now adds a symlink to the pgd-cli config file for v1 so it can be run without having to specify the path via `-f` switch. |
| Change | TPA now calls the `alter_node_kind` PGD function to ensure node kind is set correctly for BDR-Always-ON clusters using BDR version 4.3 and above. |
| Change | Default cluster configuration from now selects SLES 15 SP5 when SLES 15 is requested (previously SP4). |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue which resulted in a checksum failure during `tpaexec setup` command for tpaexec-deps users.  |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue whereby `pem_server_group` was not correctly applied when pemworker was invoked meaning servers were not grouped as expected in PEM. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue with the sys/sysstat role whereby `sar` was not scheduled to run on instances other than the Barman instance. |
