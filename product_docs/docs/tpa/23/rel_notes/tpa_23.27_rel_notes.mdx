title: Trusted Postgres Architect 23.27 release notes 
navTitle: "Version 23.27"
---

Released: 19 Dec 2023

!!! Note Migration to EDB repositories
This release of TPA lays the groundwork for the decommissioning of the legacy 2ndQuadrant repositories. 
Existing configurations that use the legacy repositories will continue to function until they are decommissioned, but a warning will be displayed.
To update an existing configuration to use EDB Repos 2.0, you may use `tpaexec reconfigure --replace-2q-repositories`.
!!!

!!! Note Python interpreter
TPA now runs using a Python interpreter provided by the `edb-python-39` package, which will be automatically installed as a dependency of the `tpaexec` package. 
This allows us to keep TPA updated with security patches on older systems where the Python version is no longer widely supported.
This is a completely standard build of Python 3.9. If you prefer, you may run TPA using another interpreter. 
We recommend 3.9, versions older than 3.9 or newer than 3.11 are not supported.
!!!

New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Trusted Postgres Architect 23.27 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | TPA now supports Oracle Linux 7, 8 and 9 on Docker. |
| Change | TPA now requires Python 3.9-3.11 and depends on the package `edb-python-39` to provide a suitable interpreter. |
| Change | TPA will no longer configure any 2ndQuadrant repositories by default, instead it will select suitable repositories from EDB Repos 2.0. |
| Change | TPA now provides a new `--replace-2q-repositories` argument to `tpaexec reconfigure` that will remove 2q repositories from an existing config.yml and add suitable EDB repositories for the cluster's postgres flavour and BDR version. |
| Change | TPA now sets file system permissions explicitly on more objects. |
| Change | A new variable `disable_repository_checks` can be set to true in config.yml to bypass the usual check for EDB repositories when deploying the PGD-Always-ON architecture. |
| Change | TPA will now generate a primary_slot_name also on primary node to be used in case of switchover, to ensure the switched primary will have a physical slot on the new primary. |
| Change | TPA will now ensure that commit_scope for CAMO enabled partners is generated using existing config options from older BDR versions when running tpaexec reconfigure command to prepare for major PGD upgrade. It also choses better defaults. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby postgres variables were rejected by Patroni due to validation rules. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby a user could not set a single `barman_client_dsn_attributes` with `sslmode=verify-full`. |
| Bug Fix | TPA will now assign a lower default `maintenance_work_mem` to avoid out-of-memory errors. |
