Released: 30 Nov 2023

New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Trusted Postgres Architect 23.26 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | TPA now supports Oracle Linux 9 on the Docker platform.|
| Enhancement | Added `--cluster-prefixed-hostnames` option to `tpaexec configure`. This makes it easy to avoid hostname clashes on machines hosting more than one docker cluster. |
| Change | Added packages to enable Docker builds on Mac OS X. |
| Change | When there are multiple PEM servers in a cluster, the agent running on a PEM server registers to its local server.|
| Change | For PGD 5 clusters with CAMO. TPA will set timeout to 60s and require_write_lead to true by default.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue whereby CAMO config was not correctly set up when upgrading a PGD 3 cluster to PGD 5. Upgrade is now fully supported for CAMO clusters. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue whereby `hostname` rather than `bdr_node_name` was used when fencing or unfencing a HARP node. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue whereby `provision` would be automatically run when `deploy` was invoked with options that suppress deployment. |
