Released: 15 Feb 2024

New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Trusted Postgres Architect 23.29 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | Added support for storing the cluster vault password in the system keyring. This leverages python keyring module to store vault password in the supported system keyring when `keyring_backend` is set to `system` (default for new clusters). This change does not impact existing clusters or any clusters that set `keyring_backend` to `legacy` in config.yml. |
| Enhancement | The `--ansible-version` argument to `tpaexec setup` now accepts `8` or `9` as valid ansible versions, as well as the existing `2q` or `community`, both of which imply ansible 2.9. The default is now `8`.  Support for ansible 9 is experimental and requires python 3.10 or above.  |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue whereby edb_repositories already defined in config.yml are not kept during reconfigure. Fixes bdr4 to pgd5 upgrade scenario in air gapped environment.  |
| Bug Fix |Fixed a bug in the password generation steps for tpaexec upgrade.  |
