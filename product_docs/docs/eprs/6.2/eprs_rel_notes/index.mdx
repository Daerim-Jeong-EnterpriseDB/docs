## Installation and upgrade notes

To install Replication Server 6.2.x for the first time or to upgrade to the 
latest Replication Server 6.2.x release from an earlier Replication Server 6.2.x release using the EDB repository, you must use the 
`--exclude edb-xdb` option with the install or upgrade command. 
If the exclude option is not used, Replication Server version 7.x is 
installed.

To upgrade:

```
<package_manager> upgrade ppas-xdb* --exclude edb-xdb*
```

To do a fresh install:

```
<package_manager> install ppas-xdb --exclude edb-xdb
```

Where `<package_manager>` varies by operating system:
