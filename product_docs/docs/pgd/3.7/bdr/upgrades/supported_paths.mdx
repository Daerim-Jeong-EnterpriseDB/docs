!!! Note
BDR versions 3.6.20, 3.6.21, 3.6.23, 3.6.24, and 3.6.26 can't be upgraded directly to 3.7 versions. Instead, you can first upgrade to BDR version 3.6.27 or later and then upgrade to a 3.7 version.

### Upgrading within version 3.7

BDR 3.7 does not follow semantic versioning. Instead, it uses 2 position majors similar to PostgreSQL releases prior to version 10 (e.g. 9.6).  BDR 3.7 also considered releases prior to 3.7.9 as beta releases and they could include breaking changes.  BDR 3.7.9 was declared a Long Term Sppoort version under the previous versioning nomenclature.  All releses 3.7.9 and later maintain backward compatibility allowing upgrades to later versions.

| 3.7.8 | 3.7.9 and later | Target BDR version(s) |
| ----- | --------------- | --------------------- |
|       | X               | 3.7.10 and later      |
| X     |                 | 3.7.9                 |
