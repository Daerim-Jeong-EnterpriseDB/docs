### Upgrading from version 3.6 to version 3.7

It is recommended that you upgrade your cluster to the latest version of 3.6 before upgrading your cluster to 3.7.  You will then be able to upgrade to a version of 3.7 released on the same date or later as shown below. 

| 3.6.22-23 | 3.6.25-26 | 3.6.27 | 3.6.28 | 3.6.29 and later | Target BDR version(s) |
| --------- | --------- | ------ | ------ | ---------------- | --------------------- |
|           |           |        |        | X                | 3.7.14 and later      |
|           |           |        | X      |                  | 3.7.13 and later      |
|           |           | X      |        |                  | 3.7.11 and later      |
|           | X         |        |        |                  | 3.7.6 and later       |
| X         |           |        |        |                  | 3.7.4 and later       |


### Upgrading within version 3.7

BDR 3.7 does not follow semantic versioning. Instead, it uses 2 position majors similar to PostgreSQL releases prior to version 10 (e.g. 9.6).  BDR 3.7 also considered releases prior to 3.7.9 as beta releases and they could include breaking changes.  BDR 3.7.9 was declared a Long Term Sppoort version under the previous versioning nomenclature.  All releses 3.7.9 and later maintain backward compatibility allowing upgrades to any later versions.

| 3.7.8 | 3.7.9 and later | Target BDR version(s) |
| ----- | --------------- | --------------------- |
|       | X               | 3.7.10 and later      |
| X     |                 | 3.7.9                 |
