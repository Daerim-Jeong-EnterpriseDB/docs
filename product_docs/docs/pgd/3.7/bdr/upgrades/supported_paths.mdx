### Upgrading within version 3.7

BDR 3.7 does not follow semantic versionoing. Instead, it uses 2 position majors similar to PostgreSQL releases prior to version 10 (e.g. 9.6).  BDR 3.7 also considered releases prior to 3.7.9 as beta releases and they could include breaking changes.  BDR 3.7.9 was declared a Long Term Sppoort version under the previous versioning nomenclature.  All releses 3.7.9 and later maintain backward compatibility allowing upgrades to later versions.
