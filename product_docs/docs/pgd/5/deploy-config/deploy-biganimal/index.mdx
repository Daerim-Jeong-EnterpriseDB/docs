EDB Postgres® AI Cloud Services (formerly BigAnimal) is a fully managed database-as-a-service with built-in Oracle compatibility. It runs in your cloud account or the cloud account of EDB Postgres® AI Cloud Services, where it's operated by our Postgres experts. EDB Postgres® AI Cloud Services make it easy to set up, manage, and scale your databases. The addition of distributed high-availability support powered by EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) enables single- and multi-region Always-on clusters. 

This section covers how to work with EDB Postgres Distributed when deployed on EDB Postgres® AI Cloud Services. 

* [Creating a distributed high-availability cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/creating_a_dha_cluster/) in the EDB Postgres AI Cloud Services (formerly BigAnimal) documentation works through the steps needed to:
  * Prepare your cloud environment for a distributed high-availability cluster
  * Sign in to EDB Postgres® AI Cloud 
  * Create a distributed high-availability cluster, including:
    * Creating and configuring a data group
    * Optionally creating and configuring a second data group in a different region
