title: 'Known issues'
---

This section discusses currently known issues in EDB Postgres Distributed 5.
These known issues are tracked in PGD's ticketing system and are expected to be
resolved in a future release.

-   The Decoding Worker feature doesn't work with CAMO/EAGER/Group Commit.
    Installations using CAMO/Eager/Group Commit must keep `enable_wal_decoder`
    disabled.

-   Lag control doesn't adjust commit delay in any way on a fully
    isolated node, that is, in case all other nodes are unreachable or not
    operational. As soon as at least one node is connected, replication
    lag control picks up its work and adjusts the PGD commit delay
    again.

-   Different `commit_decision` values cannot be combined in a single commit
    scope. Eager Replication currently only works by using the "global" PGD
    commit scope.

-   Transactions using Eager Replication can't yet execute DDL,
    nor do they support explicit two-phase commit.
    The TRUNCATE command is allowed.

-   Not all DDL can be run when either CAMO or Group Commit is used.

-   Parallel apply is not currently supported in combination with Group Commit,
    please make sure to disable it when using Group Commit by either setting
    `num_writers` to 1 for the node group (using
    [`bdr.alter_node_group_config`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces/#bdralter_node_group_config))
    or via the GUC `bdr.writers_per_subscription` (see [Configuration of Generic
    Replication](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings/#generic-replication)).

-   There currently is no protection against altering or removing a commit
    scope. Running transactions in a commit scope that is concurrently being
    altered or removed can lead to the transaction blocking or replication
    stalling completely due to an error on the downstream node attempting to
    apply the transaction. Ensure that any transactions using a specific commit
    scope have finished before altering or removing it.

-   The [PGD CLI](cli) can return stale data on the state of the cluster if it
    is still connecting to nodes that have previously been parted from the
    cluster. Edit the
    [`pgd-cli-config.yml`](cli/installing_cli/#specifying-database-connection-strings)
    file or change your [`--dsn`](cli/#passing-a-database-connection-string)
    settings to ensure only active nodes in the cluster are listed for
    connection.

Details of other design or implementation [limitations](limitations) are also available.
