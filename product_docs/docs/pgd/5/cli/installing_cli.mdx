You can install PGD CLI on any system that can connect to the PGD cluster. To use PGD CLI, you need a user with PGD superuser privileges or equivalent. The PGD user with superuser privileges is the [bdr_superuser role](../security). An example of an equivalent user is edb_admin on an EDB BigAnimal distributed high-availability cluster.

## Installing automatically with Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA)

By default, Trusted Postgres Architect installs and configures PGD CLI on each PGD node. If you want to install PGD CLI on any non-PGD instance in the cluster, attach the pgdcli role to that instance in Trusted Postgres Architect's configuration file before deploying. See [Trusted Postgres Architect](/tpa/latest/) for more information.

## Installing manually on Linux

PGD CLI is installable from the EDB repositories, which you can access with your EDB account. Both PGD users and BigAnimal users, including those on a free trial, will have an EDB account and access to PGD CLI.

 These repositories require a token to enable downloads from them. To obtain your token, log in to [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads). If this is your first time visiting the EDB Repos 2.0 page, you must click 'Request Access' to generate your token. Once a generated token is available, click on the copy icon to copy it directly to your clipboard or click on the eye icon to view it.

Once you have the token, execute the command shown for your operating system, substituting
your token for `<your-token>`. 

### Add repository and install PGD CLI on Debian or Ubuntu

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/<your-token>/postgres_distributed/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
sudo apt-get install edb-pgd5-cli
```

### Add repository and install PGD CLI on RHEL, Rocky, AlmaLinux, or Oracle Linux

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/<your-token>/postgres_distributed/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash
sudo yum install edb-pgd5-cli
```
