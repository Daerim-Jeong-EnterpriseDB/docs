EDB BigAnimal is a fully managed database-as-a-service with built-in Oracle compatibility that runs in your cloud account or BigAnimal's cloud account where it's operated by our Postgres experts. EDB BigAnimal makes it easy to set up, manage, and scale your databases. The addition of distributed high-availability support powered by EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) enables single- and and multi-region Always On Gold clusters. 

 This section of the manual covers how to work with EDB Postgres Distributed when deployed on BigAnimal. 

* [Creating a Distributed High Availability cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/creating_a_dha_cluster/) in the BigAnimal documentation works through the steps needed to:
  * Prepare your cloud environment for a distributed high-availability cluster
  * Signing in to BigAnimal
  * Create a distributed high-availability cluster
    * Including creating and configuring a data group
    * And optionally creating and configuring a second data group in a different region.
