## Explore replication with PGD

With the cluster up and running, it's worthwhile to run some basic checks to see how effectively it's replicating.

The following example shows one quick way to do this, but you must ensure that any testing you perform is appropriate for your use case.

* **Preparation**
  * Ensure the cluster is ready:  
    * Log in to the database on first host. 
    * Run `select bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(NULL, NULL);`.  
    * When the query returns, the cluster is ready.  

* **Create data**
  The simplest way to test that the cluster is replicating is to log in to a node, create a table, and populate it. On the first node, 
    * Create a table:
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE quicktest ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, value INT ); 
      ```
    * Populate the table:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO quicktest (value) SELECT random()*10000
    FROM generate_series(1,10000);
    ```
    * Monitor replication performance:
    ```sql
    select * from bdr.node_replication_rates;
    ```
    * Get a sum of the value column (for checking):
    ```sql
    select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
    ```

* **Check data**
   * Log in to a second node.
     * Get a sum of the value column (for checking):
      ```sql
      select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
      ```
     * Compare with the result from first node.
   * Log in to a third node. 
     * get a sum of the value column (for checking):
      ```sql
      select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
      ```
   * Compare with the result from the first and second nodes.

## Worked example

### Preparation

Our cluster has three data nodes, kaboom, kaftan and kaolin. We will use kaboom as our first node. Log in to kaboom and then into kaboom's Postgres server. 

```
cd democluster
ssh -F ssh_config kaboom
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

#### Ensure the cluster is ready

To ensure that the cluster is ready to go, run: 

```
select bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(NULL, NULL);
__OUTPUT__
 wait_slot_confirm_lsn
-----------------------

(1 row)
```

This query waits if the cluster is busy initializing and returns when the cluster is ready.

### Create data

#### On the first node (kaboom), create a table

Run:

```sql
CREATE TABLE quicktest ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, value INT ); 
__OUTPUT__
CREATE TABLE
```

#### On kaboom, populate the table

```
INSERT INTO quicktest (value) SELECT random()*10000 FROM generate_series(1,10000);
__OUTPUT__
INSERT 0 10000
```

This command generates a table of 10000 rows of random values. 

#### On kaboom, monitor performance

As soon as possible, run:

```sql
select * from bdr.node_replication_rates;
__OUTPUT__
 peer_node_id | target_name | sent_lsn  | replay_lsn | replay_lag | replay_lag_bytes | replay_lag_size | apply_rate | catchup_interval
--------------+-------------+-----------+------------+------------+------------------+-----------------+------------+------------------
   3490219809 | kaftan      | 0/F57D120 | 0/F57D120  | 00:00:00   |                0 | 0 bytes         |       9158 | 00:00:00
   2111777360 | kaolin      | 0/F57D120 | 0/F57D120  | 00:00:00   |                0 | 0 bytes         |       9293 | 00:00:00
(2 rows)
```

The command shows statistics about how quickly that data was replicated to the other two nodes:


Note that the replay_lag values are 0, showing no lag, and the LSN values are in sync, meaning the data is already replicated.

#### On kaboom get a checksum

Run:

```sql
select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
```

This command calculates a sum of the values from the generated data:

```sql
bdrdb=# select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
__OUTPUT__
 count  |    sum
--------+-----------
 100000 | 498884606
(1 row)
```

Your sum will be different because the values in the table are random numbers, but the count should be 100000.

### Check data

Our second host will be "kaftan". In another window (or session), log in to kaftan's Postgres server:

```
cd democluster
ssh -F ssh_config kaftan
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

#### On the second node (kaftan), get a checksum

Run:

```sql
select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
```

This command gets node-two's values for the generated data:

```sql
bdrdb=# select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
__OUTPUT__
 count  |    sum
--------+-----------
 100000 | 498884606
(1 row)
```

#### Compare with the result from the first node (kaboom)

The values are identical.

You can repeat the process with the third node (kaolin), or generate new data on any node and see it replicate to the other nodes.

#### Log in to the third node (kaolin)

The last node is kaolin, our third node. In another window(or session), log in to the kaolin and then into kaolin's Postgres server:

```
cd democluster
ssh -F ssh_config kaolin
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

#### On kaolin, get a checksum

Run:

```sql
select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
```

This command gets kaolin's values for the generated data:

```sql
bdrdb=# select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
__OUTPUT__
 count  |    sum
--------+-----------
 100000 | 498884606
(1 row)
```

#### Compare the results.

Compare the the result from the first and second nodes (kaboom and kaftan) with the result from kaolin. The values will be identical on all three nodes.
