## PGD and other PostgreSQL extensions

PGD is implemented as a PostgreSQL extension (see [Supported Postgres database servers
](overview/#supported-postgres-database-servers)), taking advantage of PostgreSQL's
expandability and flexibility to modify system behaviour at quite a low level.

In principle other extensions - both those provided by community PostgreSQL and
EPAS, as well as third-party extensions, can be used together with PGD, however
the distributed nature of PGD means selection and installation of extensions
should be carefully considered and planned.

### Extensions providing logical decoding

Extensions providing logical decoding, such as [wal2json](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json),
may in theory work with PGD, but there is no support for failover, meaning any WAL stream
being read from such an extension may be interrupted.

### Extensions providing replication and/or HA functionality

Any extension extending PostgreSQL with functionality related to replication
and/or HA/failover is unlikely to work well with PGD, and may even be detrimental
to the health of the PGD cluster, so should be avoided.

### Supported extensions

This section lists extensions which are known to work with PGD.

#### EDB Advanced Server Table Access methods

The [EDB Advanced Storage Pack](/pg_extensions/advanced_storage_pack/) provides
a selection of table access methods (TAMs) implemented as extensions of which
the following are certified for use with PGD:

 - [Autocluster](/pg_extensions/advanced_storage_pack/#autocluster)
 - [Refdata](/pg_extensions/advanced_storage_pack/#refdata)

For more details, see [Table access methods](table-access-methods).

#### pgaudit

PGD has been modified to ensure compatibility with the [pgaudit](https://www.pgaudit.org/) extension.

### Installing extensions

PostgreSQL extensions provide SQL objects such as functions and datatypes, and
optionally also one or more shared libraries, which must be loaded into the
PostgreSQL backend before the extension can be installed and used.

!!! Warning

    The relevant extension packages must be available on all nodes in the cluster,
    otherwise extension installation may fail and impact cluster stability.

#### Configuring "shared_preload_libraries"

If an extension provides a shared library, this library must be included in the [shared_preload_libraries](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-SHARED-PRELOAD-LIBRARIES)
configuration parameter before the extension itself is installed.

`shared_preload_libraries` consists of a comma-separated list of extension
names. It must include the `bdr` extension.  The order in which other extensions
are specified is generally unimportant, however if using the `pgaudit`
extension, this **must** appear in the list before `bdr`.

See also [Postgres settings](../postgres-configuration/#postgres-settings).

!!! Warning

    `shared_preload_libraries` should be configured on all nodes in the cluster before
    installing the extension with `CREATE EXTENSION`. Note that it requires a PostgreSQL
    restart for the new configuration to be activiated.

!!! Note

    In older PGD versions, the `pglogical` extension needed to be included in
    `shared_preload_libraries`. From PGD 4, `pglogical` is incorporated in
    the `bdr` extension and should no longer be installed.


#### Installing the extension

The extension itself is installed with the `CREATE EXTENSION` command. This only
needs to be carried out on one node in the cluster - PGD's DDL replication will
ensure it is propagated to all other nodes.

!!! Warning

    Do not attempt to install extensions manually on each node by e.g. disabling
    DDL replication before executing `CREATE EXTENSION`.

    Do not use a command such as `bdr.replicate_ddl_command()`
    to execute `CREATE EXTENSION`.

Ensure the extension is installed on all nodes before attempting to use it.
