| BDR       | 5.4.1  | Fixed WAL retention logic: prevent a PGD node from running out of disk space due to a bug in 5.4.0 in combination with Postgres 16, PGE 16, and EPAS 16.<br/>Make sure WAL gets properly cleaned even after 4 GB of WAL produced on a node. A change in 5.4.0 caused WAL to be retained forever after that point. This issue affects only release PGD 5.4.0 in combination with Postgres 16, PGE 16, and EPAS 16.                                                |                  |
