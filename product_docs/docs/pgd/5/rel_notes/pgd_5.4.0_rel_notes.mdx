Released: 05 Mar 2024

EDB Postgres Distributed version 5.4.0 is a minor version of EDB Postgres Distributed.

!!! Important Recommended upgrade
We recommend that all users of PGD 5 upgrade to PGD 5.4. See [PGD/TPA upgrades](../upgrades/tpa_overview) for details.

## Highlights of EDB Postgres Distributed 5.4.0

Ensuring that your data and transactions flow reliably and without interruption
has been a focus of EDB Postgres Distributed 5.4 and is part of the foundational
work for future developments in PGD. 

* PGD 5.4 enhances its overall resiliance with a new feature that is capable of
  automatically synchronizing nodes to the furthest ahead node in the event of a
  transaction originating node failing or disconnecting. This further reduces
  your exposure to paritial replication during failure.
* Building on that, another feature in PGD 5.4 allows pending group commit
  transactions to be automatically resolved when their oriignating node fails or
  disconnects. This improvement allows your group commit transactions to
  complete their journey even if their source node is no longer available._createMdxContent
* To enable the creation of delayed read-only replica groups with
  subscriber-only nodes, the `apply_delay` option is now available for subgroups
  of PGD. The change opens up the possibility of additional disaster-recovery
  options or mitigating against unexpected `DROP TABLE` human errors.
* Making it more effiecient to load data into your PGD cluster and rounding out the
  features of PGD 5.4, all modes in EDB Postgres Advanced Server's
  [EBD*Loader](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/database_administration/02_edb_loader/),
  except direct modes, are now supported. 



## Compatibility

!!! Note EDB Server version compatibility
This version requires the recently released Postgres versions 14.10, 15.4,
or 16.1 (or later) of EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended
Server. No such restrictions exist for PostgreSQL Server.

Package managers on Debian, RHEL, and SLES pull in the required EDB Postgres
Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended upgrades with an upgrade of EDB
Postgres Distributed.
