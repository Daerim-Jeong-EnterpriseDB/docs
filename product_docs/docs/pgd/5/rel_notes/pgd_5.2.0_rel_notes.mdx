navTitle: "Version 5.2.0"
---

EDB Postgres Distributed version 5.2.0 is a minor version of EDB Postgres Distributed.
This version addresses security vulnerabilities in dependencies for PGD Proxy and PGD CLI.

## Highlights of EDB  Postgres Distributed 5.2

* Parallel apply is now available for PGD’s Commit at Most Once (CAMO) synchronous commit scope and improving replication performance.
* Parallel apply for native Postgres asynchronous and synchronous replication has been improved for workloads where the same key is being modified concurrently by multiple transactions to maintain commit sequence and avoid deadlocks
* PGD Proxy has added HTTP(S) API’s to allow the health of the proxy to be monitored directly for readiness and liveness. See [Proxy Health Check](../routing/proxy/#proxy-health-check)

!!! Important Recommended upgrade
    We recommend that users of PGD 5.1 upgrade to PGD 5.2.

!!! Note PostgreSQL version compatibility
This version is required for EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions 12.15, 13.11, 14.8, and later.
