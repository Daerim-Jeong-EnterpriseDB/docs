| BDR       | 5.5.1   | <details><summary>Fix a data inconsistency issue with mixed version usage during upgrades</summary>Upgrading from any previous PGD version to PGD 5.5.0 may result in inconsistencies when replicating from the newer PGD 5.5.0 node to an older version PGD node. This release fixes mixed version operation to allow for smooth rolling upgrades.</details> |        |
| BDR       | 5.5.1   | <details><summary>Disabled auto-triggering of node sync by default</summary>Automatically triggered synchronization of data from a down node caused issues by failing to resume once it came back up. As a precautionary measure, the feature is now disabled by default (PGD setting [`bdr.enable_auto_sync_reconcile`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrenable_auto_sync_reconcile)).</details>                                                                               | 11510  |
