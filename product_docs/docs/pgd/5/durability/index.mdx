EDB Postgres Distributed offers a range of synchronous modes to complement its
default asynchronous replication. These synchronous modes are configured through
commit scopes; rules that define how operations are handled and when the system
should consider a transaction committed. 

## Introducing 

* [Overview](overview) introduces these concepts and some of the essential 
terminology which is used when discussing synchronous commits.

* [Comparing](comparing) compares how each option behaves.

* [Configuring](configuring) shows how you can use the PGD SQL interface to set up
commit scopes which manage the various synchronous commit options.

* [Commit Scopes](commit-scopes) is a more in-depth look at the syntax and structure
of commit scopes and how to define them for your needs.

## Commit scope kinds

* [Group Commit](group-commit) focuses on the Group Commit option, where you can
define a transaction as done when a group of nodes agrees its done.

* [CAMO](camo) focuses on the Commit At Most Once option, which allows applications
to participate in confirming a transaction has been done and in turn ensure that
their commits only happen at most once.

* [Lag Control](lag-control) looks at the commit scope mechanism which regulates how
far out of sync nodes may go when a database node goes out of service.

* [Synchronous Commit](synchronous_commit) examines a commit scope mechanism which works
in a similar fashion to legacy synchronous replication, but from within the commit scope framework.

## Working with commit scopes

* [Administering](administering) addresses how a PGD cluster with Group Commit
in use should be managed.

* [Legacy Synchronous Replication](legacy-sync) shows how traditional Postgres synchronous operations
can still be accessed under EDB Postgres Distributed.

* [Internal timing of operations](timing) compared Legacy replication with PGD's async and synchronous
operations, especially the difference in the order by which transactions are flushed to disk or made visible.

* [Limitations](limitations) lists the various combinations of durability options
which are not currently supported or not possible. Do refer to this before deciding
on a durability strategy.
