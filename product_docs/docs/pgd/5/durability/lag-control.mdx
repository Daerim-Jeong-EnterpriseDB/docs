Commit scope kind: `LAG CONTROL`

## Overview

Lag Control provides a mechanism where, if replication is running outside of
limits set, a delay is injected into the origin node's client connections after
processing transactions that make replicable updates. This delay is designed to
slow the incoming transactions and bring replication back within the defined
limits.

## Background

The data throughput of database applications on a PGD origin node can exceed the
rate at which committed data can replicate to downstream peer nodes.

If this imbalance persists, it can put satisfying organizational objectives 
such as RPO, RCO, and GEO at risk.

-  **RPO** (Recovery point objective) specifies the maximum-tolerated amount of data
   that can be lost due to unplanned events, usually expressed as an amount of
   time. In PGD, RPO determines the acceptable amount of committed data that
   hasn't been applied to one or more peer nodes.

-  **RCO** (Resource constraint objective) acknowledges that there is finite storage
   available. In PGD, the demands on these storage resources increase as lag increases.

-  **GEO** (Group elasticity objective) ensures that any node isn't originating new
   data at a rate that can't be saved to its peer nodes. 

To allow organizations to achieve their objectives, PGD offers Lag Control. This
feature provides a means to precisely regulate the potential imbalance without
intruding on applications, by transparently introducing a delay to READ WRITE
transactions that modify data. This delay, the PGD Commit Delay, starts at 0ms.

Using the LAG CONTROL commit scope kind, you can set a maximum time that commits
commits can be delayed between nodes in a group, maximum lag time or maximum lag
size (based on the size of the WAL). 

If the nodes can process transactions within the specified maximums on enough
nodes, the PGD commit delay will stay at 0ms or be reduced towards 0ms. If the 
maximums are exceeded on enough nodes though the PGD commit delay on the 
originating node is increased. It will continue increasing until the lag control 
constraints are met on enough nodes again.

The PGD commit delay happens after a transaction has completed and released all
its locks and resources. This timing of the delay allows concurrent active
transactions to carry on observing and modifying the delayed transactions values
and acquiring its resources.

Strictly speaking, the PGD commit delay isn't a per-transaction delay.
It's the mean value of commit delays over a stream of transactions for a
particular client connection. This technique allows the commit delay and
fine-grained adjustments of the value to escape the coarse granularity of
OS schedulers, clock interrupts, and variation due to system load. It also
allows the PGD runtime commit delay to settle within microseconds of the
lowest duration possible to maintain a lag measure threshold.

!!! Note PGD commit delay != Postgres commit delay
Don't conflate the PGD commit delay with the [Postgres commit
delay](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-COMMIT-DELAY).
They are unrelated and perform different functions. Don't substitute one for the
other.

## Requirements

To get started using Lag Control:

-   Determine the maximum acceptable commit delay time `max_commit_delay` that
    all database applications can tolerate.

-   Decide on the lag measure to use. Choose either lag size `max_lag_size` or
    lag time `max_lag_time`.

-   Decide on the groups or subgroups involved and the minimum number of nodes
    in each collection required to satisfy confirmation. This information forms
    the basis for the definition of a commit scope rule.

## Configuration

You specify lag control in a commit scope, which allows consistent and
coordinated parameter settings across the nodes spanned by the commit scope
rule. You can include a lag control specification in the default commit scope of
a top group or as part of an origin group commit scope.

As in example, take a configuration with two datacenters, `left_dc` and `right_dc`, represented as sub-groups:

```sql
SELECT bdr.create_node_group(
    node_group_name := 'left_dc',
    parent_group_name := 'top_group',
    join_node_group := false
);
SELECT bdr.create_node_group(
    node_group_name := 'right_dc',
    parent_group_name := 'top_group',
    join_node_group := false
);
```

The code below adds Lag Control rules for those two data centers, using individual rules for each subgroup:

```sql
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'left_dc',
    rule := 'ALL (left_dc) LAG CONTROL (max_commit_delay=500ms, max_lag_time=30s) AND ANY 1 (right_dc) LAG CONTROL (max_commit_delay=500ms, max_lag_time=30s)',
    wait_for_ready := true
);
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'right_dc',
    rule := 'ANY 1 (left_dc) LAG CONTROL (max_commit_delay=0.250ms, max_lag_size=100MB) AND ALL (right_dc) LAG CONTROL (max_commit_delay=0.250ms, max_lag_size=100MB)',
    wait_for_ready := true
);
```

You can add a lag control commit scope rule to existing commit scope rules that
also include group commit and CAMO rule specifications.

The `max_commit_delay` is interval, typically specified in milliseconds (1ms).
Using fractional values for sub-millisecond precision is supported.

The `max_lag_size` is an integer which specifies the maximum allowed lag in
terms of WAL bytes. 

The `max_lag_time` is an interval, typically specified in seconds, that
specifies the maximum allowed lag in terms of time.

The maximum commit delay (`max_commit_delay`) is a ceiling value representing a hard limit,
which means that a commit delay never exceeds the configured value.

The maximum lag size and time (`max_lag_size` and `max_lag_time`) are soft limits that can be exceeded.
When the maximum commit delay is reached,
there's no additional back pressure on the lag measures to prevent their
continued increase.


## Transaction application

The PGD commit delay is applied to all READ WRITE transactions that
modify data for user applications. This behavior implies that any transaction
that doesn't modify data, including declared READ WRITE transactions,
is exempt from the commit delay.

Asynchronous transaction commit also executes a PGD commit delay. This
might appear counterintuitive, but asynchronous commit, by virtue of its
performance, can be one of the greatest sources of replication lag.

Postgres and PGD auxillary processes don't delay at transaction commit.
Most notably, PGD writers don't execute a commit delay when applying
remote transactions on the local node. This is by design, as PGD writers
contribute nothing to outgoing replication lag and can reduce incoming
replication lag the most by not having their transaction commits throttled
by a delay.

## Limitations

The maximum commit delay is a ceiling value representing a hard limit,
which means that a commit delay never exceeds the configured value.
Conversely, the maximum lag measures both by size and time and
are soft limits that can be exceeded. When the maximum commit delay is reached,
there's no additional back pressure on the lag measures to prevent their
continued increase.

There's no way to exempt origin transactions that don't modify PGD
replication sets from the commit delay. For these transactions, it
can be useful to SET LOCAL the maximum transaction delay to 0.

## Caveats

Application TPS is one of many factors that can affect replication lag.
Other factors include the average size of transactions for which PGD commit
delay can be less effective. In particular, bulk load operations can
cause replication lag to rise, which can trigger a concomitant rise in
the PGD runtime commit delay beyond the level reasonably expected by normal
applications, although still under the maximum allowed delay.

Similarly, an application with a very high OLTP requirement and modest
data changes can be unduly restrained by the acceptable PGD commit delay
setting.

In these cases, it can be useful to use the `SET [SESSION|LOCAL]` command to
custom configure Lag Control settings for those applications or modify
those applications. For example, bulk load operations are sometimes split
into multiple, smaller transactions to limit transaction snapshot duration
and WAL retention size or establish a restart point if the bulk load fails.
In deference to Lag Control, those transaction commits can also schedule very
long PGD commit delays to allow digestion of the lag contributed by the
prior partial bulk load.

## Meeting organizational objectives

In the example objectives list earlier:

-   RPO can be met by setting an appropriate maximum lag time.
-   RCO can be met by setting an appropriate maximum lag size.
-   GEO can be met by monitoring the PGD runtime commit delay
    and the PGD runtime lag measures,

As mentioned, when the maximum PGD runtime commit delay is
pegged at the PGD configured commit-delay limit, and the lag
measures consistently exceed their PGD-configured maximum
levels, this scenario can be a marker for PGD group expansion.

## Lag Control and Extensions

The PGD commit delay is a post-commit delay. It occurs after the transaction has
committed and after all Postgres resources locked or acquired by the transaction
are released. Therefore, the delay doesn't prevent concurrent active
transactions from observing or modifying its values or acquiring its resources.
The same guarantee can't be made for external resources managed by Postgres
extensions. Regardless of extension dependencies, the same guarantee can be made
if the PGD extension is listed before extension-based resource managers in
postgresql.conf.
