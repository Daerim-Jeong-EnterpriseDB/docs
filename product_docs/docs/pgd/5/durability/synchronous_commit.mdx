Commit scope kind: `SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT`

## Overview

PGD's `SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT` is a commit scope kind that works in a way that is more like PostgreSQL's [Synchronous commit](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-SYNCHRONOUS-COMMIT) option in its underlying operation. Unlike the PostgreSQL option though, it is configured as a commit scope and is easier to configure and interact with within PGD. 

Unlike other commit scope kinds such as GROUP COMMIT and CAMO, the transactions in a SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT operation will not be transformed into a two phase commit (2PC) transaction, but work more like a Postgres Synchronous commit.

## Example

```
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_sc_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'left_dc',
    rule := 'MAJORITY (left_dc) SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT',
    wait_for_ready := true
);
```

In this example, any node in the `left_dc` group, when this commit scope is in use, will use `SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT` to replicate changes to the other nodes in the `left_dc` group. It will look for a majority of nodes in the `left_dc` group to confirm that they have committed the transaction.

## Configuration

There are no parameters for `SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT` and therefore no configuration.

## Confirmation

   Confirmation&nbsp;Level    | PGD Synchronous Commit Handling
-------------------------|-------------------------------
 `received`              | A remote PGD node confirms the transaction immediately after receiving it, prior to starting the local application.
 `replicated`            | Confirms after applying changes of the transaction but before flushing them to disk.
 `durable`               | Confirms the transaction after all of its changes are flushed to disk.
 `visible` (default)     | Confirms the transaction after all of its changes are flushed to disk and it's visible to concurrent transactions.

## Details

Currently `SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT` does not use the confirmation levels of the commit scope rule syntax.
