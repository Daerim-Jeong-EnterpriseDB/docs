title: Commit scope rules
---

Commit scope rules are at the core of the commit scope mechanism. They define what the commit scope will enforce. 

Commit scope rules are composed of one or more operations combined with an `AND`.

Each operation is made up of two (or three) parts, the commit scope group, an optional confirmation level, and the kind of commit scope (which may have it's own parameters). 

```
commit_scope_group [ confimation_level ] commit_scope_kind
```

A full formal syntax diagram is available in the [commit scope reference section.](/pgd/latest/reference/commit-scopes/#commit-scope-syntax).

If we look at a typical commit scope rule, we can now break it down into its components:

```
ANY 2 (group) GROUP COMMIT
```

The `ANY 2 (group)` is the commit scope group, specifying, for the rule, of which nodes need to respond, confirming they have processed the transaction. Specifically, here, any two nodes from the named group must confirm.

There is no confirmation level here, but that only means that the default is used. You can think of the rule in full as:

```
ANY 2 (group) ON visible GROUP COMMIT
```

The visible setting means the nodes are able to confirm once the all the transaction's changes are flushed to disk and visible to other transactions.

The last part of this operation is the commit scope kind, which here is `GROUP COMMIT`, a synchronous two-phase commit which will be confirmed when any two nodes in the named group confirm they have flushed and made visible the transactions changes.

## The commit scope group

There are three kinds of commit scope group, `ANY`, `ALL` and `MAJORITY`. They are all followed by a parenthesed list of one or more groups, which combine to make a pool of nodes that this operation will apply to.

- `ANY` &mdash is followed by an integer value, "n". It translates to any "n" nodes in the listed groups nodes.
- `ALL` &mdash is followed by the groups and translates to all nodes in the listed groups noes.
- `MAJORITY` &mdsh is followed by the groups and translates to requiring a half, plus one, of the listed groups nodes to confirm to give a majority.

## The confirmation Level

PGD nodes can send confirmations for a transaction at different times. In increasing levels of protection, from the perspective of the confirming node, these are:

- `received` &mdash; A remote PGD node confirms the transaction immediately after receiving it, prior to starting the local application.
- `replicated` &mdash; Confirms after applying changes of the transaction but before flushing them to disk.
- `durable` &mdash; Confirms the transaction after all of its changes are flushed to disk.
- `visible` (default) &mdash; Confirms the transaction after all of its changes are flushed to disk and it's visible to concurrent transactions.

In rules for commit scopes, you can append these confirmation levels to the node group definition in parentheses with `ON` as follows:

- `ANY 2 (right_dc) ON replicated`
- `ALL (left_dc) ON visible` (default)
- `ALL (left_dc) ON received AND ANY 1 (right_dc) ON durable`

!!! Note
If you are familiar with Postgresql's `synchronous_standby_names` feature, be aware that while the grammar for `synchronous_standby_names` and commit scopes can look similar, there is a subtle difference. The former doesn't account for the origin node, but the latter does. For example `synchronous_standby_names = 'ANY 1 (..)'` is equivalent to a commit scope of `ANY 2 (...)`.  This difference makes reasoning about majority easier and reflects that the origin node also contributes to the durability and visibility of the transaction.

## The Commit Scope kind

There are, currently, four commit scope kinds. Each of them has their own page, so we'll be summarizing and linking to them here:

### `GROUP COMMIT`

Group commit is a synchronous two-phase commit which will be confirmed according to the requirements of the commit scope group. `GROUP COMMIT` has a number of options which control whether transactions should be tracked over interruptions (boolean, defaults to off), how conflicts should be resolved (`async` or `eager`, defaults to `async`) and how a consensus is obtained (`group`, `partner` or `raft`, defaults to `group`).

For further details see [`GROUP COMMIT`](group-commit).

### `CAMO`

Camo, Commit At Most Once, allows the client/application, origin node and partner node to ensure that a transaction is committed to the database at most once. Because the client is involved in the process, the application will require modifications to participate in the CAMO process. 

For further details see [`CAMO`](camo).

### `LAG CONTROL`

With Lag control, when the system's replication performance exceeds specified limits, a commit delay can be automatically injected into client interaction with the database, providing a back pressure on clients. Lag control has parameters to set the maximum commit delay that can be exerted, and limits in terms of time to process or queue size which will trigger increases in that commit delay.

### `SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT`
