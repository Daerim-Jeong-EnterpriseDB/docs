## Comparison

Most options for synchronous replication available to PGD allow for different
levels of synchronization, offering different tradeoffs between performance and
protection against node or network outages.

The following list of [confirmation levels](commit-scopes-rules#the-confirmation-level) explains
what a user should expect to see when that confirmation level in in effect and how that can effect performance, durability, and consistency.

### ON RECEIVED

**Expect**: The peer node has received the changes. Nothing has been updated in
the peer nodes tuple store or written to storage.

Confirmation on reception means that the peer operating normally can
eventually apply the transaction without requiring any further
communication, even in the face of a full or partial network
outage. A crash of a peer node might still require retransmission of
the transaction, as this confirmation doesn't involve persistent
storage. 

**For**: Good performance.

**Against**: Less robust when a crash occurs.

### ON REPLICATED

**Expect**: The peer node has received the changes and applied them to the tuple
store. The changes have not been persisted to storage.

Confirmation on replication means the peer has received and applied the changes, but 
has yet to persist them to disk. 

**For**: A better checkpoint than received with less performance.

**Against**: Less robust when a crash occurs.

### ON DURABLE

**Expect**: The peer node has received the changes, applied them to the tuple store and persisted the changes to storage. It has yet to make the changes available to other concurrent transactions.

Durable confirmation means that the transaction has been written to the peer
node's storage. This provides protection against loss of data after a crash and
recovery of the peer node. With Group Commit, this also means the changes are
visible.

**For**: More robust, able to recover without retransmission in the event of a crash.

**Against**: Doesn't guarantee consistency.

### ON VISIBLE

**Expect**: The peer node has recieved and applied the changes, and persisted them to storage, and has now made them visible to other concurrent transactions.

Confirmation on visibility means that the transaction was applied remotely. All
other clients see the results of the transaction on all nodes, providing this
guarantee immediately after the commit is confirmed by the origin node. Without
visibility, other clients connected might not see the results of the transaction
and experience stale reads.

**For**: Robust and consistent.

**Against**: Lower performance.
