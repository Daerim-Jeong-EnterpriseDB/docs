## Upgrading from version 4 to version 5

Upgrades from PGD 4 to PGD 5 are supported from version 4.3.0. For older versions, upgrade to 4.3.0 before upgrading to 5. See [Upgrading within 4](/pgd/4/upgrades/upgrade_paths/#upgrading-within-version-4) for more information. After upgrading to 4.3.0 or later, the following combinations are allowed.

| 4.3.0 | 4.3.0-1 | 4.3.1 | 4.3.1-1 | Target PGD version |

## Upgrading from version 3.7 to version 5

At this time, TPA has enabled upgrades only from PGD 3.7 to 4 and PGD 4 to 5.
If you're moving from 3.7 to 5 and want automation, you need to use this
two-step upgrade path. Using this process, it's possible your proxy architecture will change
multiple times: from HA Proxy to HARP and then to PGD Proxy.

Significant development was done to make upgrading directly from 3.7 to 5
possible and easier. We've expanded the database versions supported with PGD 5
and enabled the upgradeability of the BDR extension across multiple PGD
versions. Previously, we supported upgrades only from the previous major
version. Often, a database upgrade was also required because only one database
major version was supported by both PGD versions.  

Development is currently ongoing to provide a direct upgrade path from 3.7 to 5
using TPA by Q4. In the interim, you can reach out to EDB Professional
Services or Support for assistance and guidance.
