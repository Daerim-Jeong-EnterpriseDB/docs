  A quick demonstration of deploying a PGD architecture using TPA on Docker
---


The following steps use Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA) to set up EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) with an Always On Single Location architecture using local Docker containers.

## Introducing TPA and PGD

We created TPA to make the installation and management of various Postgres configurations easily repeatable. TPA orchestrates the creation and deployment of Postgres. In this quick start, we install TPA first. If you already have TPA installed, you can skip those steps. TPA can be used, and re-used, to deploy various configurations of Postgres clusters.

PGD is a multi-master replicating implementation of Postgres designed for high performance and availability. The installation of PGD is orchestrated by TPA. We will get TPA to generate a configuration file for a PGD demonstration cluster. This cluster uses local Docker containers to host the cluster's nodes; three replicating database nodes, two connection proxies and one backup node. We can then use TPA to provision and deploy the required configuration and software to each node.

This configuration of PGD is not suitable for production use, but can be valuable for testing the functionality and behavior of PGD clusters. You may also find it useful when familiarizing yourself with PGD commands and APIs in preparation for deployment on cloud, VM, or bare-metal platforms. 

!!! Note
This set of steps is specifically for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on Intel/AMD processors.

## Prerequisites

To complete this example, you need free storage and Docker installed. 

### Free disk space

You need at least 5GB of free storage (accessible by Docker) to deploy the cluster described by this example. A bit more is probably wise.

### Docker Engine

We use Docker containers as the target platform for this PGD deployment. If you don't have Docker installed, we recommend using [the convenience script](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#install-using-the-convenience-script) available at https://get.docker.com:

```shell
curl -1sLf https://get.docker.com | sudo -E bash
```

!!! Important Running as a non-root user
    Be sure to add your user to the Docker group once installed:

    ```shell
    sudo usermod -aG docker <username>
    newgrp docker
    ```

## Preparation

### EDB account

You'll need an EDB account in order to install both TPA *and* PGD. 

[Sign up for a free EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/register) if you don't already have one - this gives you a trial subscription to EDB's software repositories. 

Once you have registered, or if you are already registered, go to the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) page where you can obtain your "repo token". 

On your first visit to this page you have to select **Request Access** to generate your "repo token". Copy the token using the Copy Token icon and store it safely. 

### Setting environment variables

First, set the `EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN` environment variable to the value of your EDB repo token, obtained in the previous [EDB Account](#edb-account) step.

```shell
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-repo-token>
```

This can be added to your `.bashrc` script (or similar shell profile) to ensure it is always set.

### Configure the repository

All the software needed for this example is available from the Postgres Distributed package repository. We download and run a script to configure the Postgres Distributed repository. This repository also contains the TPA packages.

```shell
curl -1sLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/postgres_distributed/setup.deb.sh" | sudo -E bash
``` 

## Installing Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA)

We are using TPA to provision and deploy PGD. If you have previously installed TPA, you can move on to the [next step](#installing-pgd-using-tpa). You'll find full instructions for installing TPA in the [Trusted Postgres Architect documentation](/tpa/latest/INSTALL/), which we've included here for convenience:

### Linux environment

[TPA supports several distributions of Linux](/tpa/latest/INSTALL/) as a host platform. These examples are written for Ubuntu 22.04, but steps are similar for other supported platforms.

!!! Important
    If the Linux host platform you are using is running [cgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups) v2, you'll need to disable it and enable cgroups v1 while using TPA to deploy to Docker. 
    
    To check for cgroup v2:

    ```shell
    mount | grep cgroup | head -1
    ```

    You'll need to disable cgroup v2 if the output is:
    ```text
    cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup type cgroup2
    ```

    To disable cgroup v2:

    ```shell
    echo 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=false' | sudo tee \
      /etc/default/grub.d/cgroup.cfg
    sudo update-grub
    sudo reboot    
    ```


### Install the TPA package

```shell
sudo apt install tpaexec
```

### Configuring TPA

We now need to configure TPA which configures TPA's Python environment. Just call `tpaexec` with the command `setup`.

```shell
sudo /opt/EDB/TPA/bin/tpaexec setup
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/EDB/TPA/bin
```

You can add the export command to your shell's profile.

### Testing the TPA installation

You can verify TPA is correctly installed by running `selftest`.

```shell
tpaexec selftest
```
TPA is now installed.

## Installing PGD using TPA

### Generating a configuration file

Run the [`tpaexec configure`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-configure/) command to generate a configuration folder. 

```shell-session
tpaexec configure democluster \
  --architecture PGD-Always-ON \
  --platform docker \
  --epas \
  --location-names dc1 \
  --active-locations dc1 \
  --data-nodes-per-location 3 \
  --no-git \
  --hostnames-unsorted
```

We included options to specify using Docker, a single location, and three data nodes running [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/). By default, PGD also configures two [PGD Proxy](routing/proxy/) nodes and a [Barman](backup#physical-backup) node for backup. Rocky Linux is the default image for all nodes.

We set the notional location of the nodes to `dc1` using `--location-names`. We then activate the PGD proxies in that location using `--active-locations` set to the same location.

By default, TPA commits configuration changes to a Git repository. For this example, we don't need to do that so we pass the `--no-git` flag.

Finally, we ask TPA to generate repeatable hostnames for the nodes.

This creates a subdirectory in the current working directory called `democluster` containing the `config.yml` configuration file TPA uses to create the cluster. You can view it using:

```shell
less democluster/config.yml
```

### Provisioning the cluster

Now we allocate the resources needed to run the configuration we have just created, using the [`tpaexec provision`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-provision/) command.
   
```shell
tpaexec provision democluster
```

Since we specified Docker as the platform, TPA creates a Docker image, containers, networks, and so on.

### Deploying the cluster

With configuration in place and infrastructure provisioned, we can now [deploy](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-deploy/) the distributed cluster.

```shell
tpaexec deploy democluster
```

TPA applies the configuration, installing the needed packages and setting up the actual EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

!!! Tip
    If you see a failure while processing the `barman/first_backup` task, retry this step. Depending on the speed of your test machine, 40 retries may not be enough for initialization to complete in the relevant Docker containers. 
   
### Testing the cluster
   
After the successful run of the `deploy` command the cluster is ready to use. 

We can now run a [test](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-test/) that ensures the cluster is running as expected:

```shell
tpaexec test democluster
```

## Using the cluster

We can also do a quick hands-on test with psql. For convenience, we use the barman instance to launch psql and connect to a proxy instance. As we saw previously in config.yml, TPA has assigned the name `karakul` to the barman instance, and `kapok` to the first proxy.

```shell
docker exec -it -u barman karakul psql -h kapok -p 6432 -U barman bdrdb
```

## Deprovisioning the cluster

When you're done testing the cluster, you'll want to deprovision it. This will tear down the Docker containers, network, and so on:

```shell
tpaexec deprovision democluster
```
