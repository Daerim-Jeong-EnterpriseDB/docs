title: Role management
---

Users are global objects in a PostgreSQL instance. A `CREATE ROLE` command or its alias `CREATE USER` is replicated automatically if they're executed in a PGD replicated database. If a role or user is created in a non-PGD, un-replicated database, the role will only exist for that PostgreSQL instance. `GRANT ROLE` and `DROP ROLE` work in the same way, only replicating if applied to a PGD replicated database.

!!! Note
Remember that a user in Postgres terms is simply a role with login privileges.

## Role Rule - No un-replicated roles

It is especially important that if you do create a role or user in a non-PGD, un-replicated database, that you do not go on to make an object in the PGD replicated database rely on that role. It will break the replication process as PGD cannot replicate a role that is not in the PGD replicated database. 

This automatic replication behavior can be disabled by turning off the[ bdr.role_replication](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings/#bdrrole_replication) setting but is not recommended.


## **Roles for new nodes**

New PGD nodes that are added using[ bdr_init_physical](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/reference/nodes/#bdr_init_physical) will automatically replicate the roles from other nodes of the PGD cluster.

If a PGD node is joined to a PGD group manually, without using bdr_init_physical, existing roles aren't copied to the newly joined node. This is intentional behavior to ensure that access isn't accidentally granted.

Roles, by default, have access to all databases. Automatically copying users to a newly created node would therefore open the possibility of unintentionally exposing a database that exists on the node. If the PGD cluster had a user Alice, and Alice had been automatically created on a newly joined node, by directly connecting to that node, Alice would have access to all the databases on that node. PGD therefore doesn’t copy over existing roles and, in this situation, recommends that you copy over roles manually.

PostgreSQL allows you to dump all roles with the command:

```
pg_dumpall --roles-only > roles.sql
```

You can then edit the file `roles.sql` to remove unwanted users before re-executing that on the newly created node.

When joining a new node, the “No un-replicated roles” rule also applies. If an object in the to-be replicated database relies on an unreplicated role in an (unreplicated) local database, then the join will fail when it attempts to replicate that object.

 
## Connections and roles

When allocating a new PGD node, the user supplied in the DSN for the `local_dsn`
argument of [`bdr.create_node`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrcreate_node) and the `join_target_dsn` of [`bdr.join_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrjoin_node_group)
are used frequently to refer to, create, and manage database objects.

PGD is carefully written to prevent privilege escalation attacks even when using
a role with `SUPERUSER` rights in these DSNs.

To further reduce the attack surface, you can specify a more restricted user in
the above DSNs. At a minimum, such a user must be granted permissions on all
nodes, such that following stipulations are satisfied:

-   The user has the `REPLICATION` attribute.
-   It's granted the `CREATE` permission on the database.
-   It inherits the bdr_superuser role.
-   It owns all database objects to replicate, either directly or from
    permissions from the owner roles.

Once all nodes are joined, the permissions can be further reduced to just the
following to still allow DML and DDL replication:

-   The user has the `REPLICATION` attribute.
-   It inherits the bdr_superuser role.
