## PGD and Raft

PGD is based on a global Raft model where clusters have a single Raft group spanning all the data nodes in the PGD cluster. A Raft leader is elected by the cluster and propagates the state of the cluster to all the other nodes in the cluster. 

!!! Note
Raft is an industry accepted algorithm for making decisions though achieving “consensus” from a group of separate nodes within a distributed system. 
!!!

It is essential for certain operations in the cluster that the Raft leader – such as adding and removing nodes and allocating ranges for [galloc](sequences/#pdg-global-sequences) sequences – is both established and maintained. 

To do this requires that the majority of the nodes in the cluster be reachable by any potential Raft leader node.

It also means that one half of the nodes in the cluster, plus one additional node must be able to reach each other. So, in a global cluster with five nodes, at least three of the nodes must be reachable by each other to establish a Raft leader.

Having established a Raft leader, the cluster can then go on to select write leaders, the database node to which all write traffic is automatically dispatched to through the pgd proxies, in each location. This too requires that the global Raft group be able to achieve consensus to select the write leader in each location, and in turn inform the pgd-proxy instances to direct their updates to that node.

If the write leader in a location goes out of service, as part of the failover process all the remaining nodes will elect a new write leader for that location and the pgd proxies for that location will forward traffic to the new write leader. 

This is a simple and effective technique, which happily manages the appearance and disappearance of nodes. But there are situations where it is possible to lose the ability to failover from one node to another while the location itself is healthy.

## Quorum failure

In this scenario, there are two locations each with datacenters with the same number of nodes in them. PGD would bring all the nodes together with Raft to select write leaders in each location. In each location there are three data nodes, making a resilient local cluster.

With an odd number of nodes in each location, the clusters could allow a local majority to make decisions. But all of the locations nodes work together to make decisions like that. Most of the time, this will work well.

But consider if connectivity to one location was completely cut off. With a total number of reachable nodes reduced to half of what it was, there is no way that the Raft consensus algorithm can become quorate, and without that, it is unable to make decisions and elect leaders.

While the write leader may persist for a time, at some point a new leader will need to be selected and it's at that point that the lack of consensus would become noticable.

## Previous solutions

One previous solution to this problem has been to add an extra datacenter with a witness node which could provide consensus when a location was offline. This does require the addition of a location which is not affected by either location being down. But that would also mean when the East DC was cut off, the global cluster still had the West DC (3 nodes) and Central DC (1 node) to come to a consensus, with 4 nodes out of a global 7 voting. The reverse is also true if West DC was cut off, East DC and Central DC would still have sufficient nodes to elect leaders.

Its a simple solution, but it does require that extra datacenter and server to manage things.

Another previous solution was to add an external Raft consensus layer using etcd (https://etcd.io). This layer would be used exclusively by the proxy nodes to decide on which node at that location would be the write leader. This solution required both additional software and at least three nodes running etcd at each location. It is also no longer supported with PGD5.

## The Raft subgroup solution

Introduced in PGD5, the subgroup raft option allows the subgroups within a PGD cluster to elect the leaders they need independently. These devolved Raft subgroups still take part in top-level decision-making in the cluster, but are able to work independently when needed.

A Raft subgroup will elect it's own write leader. The subgroup will also have its own Raft leader working alongside the global group leader.



With subgroups able to make their own Raft consensus, it  means no more need for extra, redundant resources on standby for when the unlikely but possible loss of a region happens.
