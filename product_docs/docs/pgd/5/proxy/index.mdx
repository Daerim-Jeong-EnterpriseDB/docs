PGD Proxy is a daemon that acts as an abstraction layer between the client application and Postgres. It interfaces with the BDR consensus mechanism to obtain the identity of the current write leader node and redirects traffic to that node.

There is always at least one global group and one data group in the PGD cluster. BDR elects the write leader for each data group which has the `enable_proxy_routing` option set to true. Proxy can be attached to a global group or data group. There could be multiple proxies attached to each group.

PGD Proxy is a TCP layer 4 proxy. It can't encode/decode the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol. Although this may change in future releases.


## How it works

Upon starting, PGD Proxy connects to one of the endpoints given in the local config file and fetches DB connection information for all nodes, proxy options like listen address, listen port, routing details like current write leader, etc.

Proxy internally maintains watchers and PubSub mechanism to get leader change notifications on Postgres notify/listen channels.

All application client traffic then passes through the Proxy into the current write leader. If the write leader is not available then, Proxy disconnects all connection traffic until a new write leader is available. This also applies to circumstances when `pgd switchover` is used to invoke a planned transition to a new write leader. The disconnect is immediate.

## Installing PGD Proxy

### Installing through TPAexec

If PGD cluster is being created through TPAexec then it installs and configures PGD Proxy automatically. If you you wish to install PGD Proxy on any other node in PGD cluster then, you simply need to attach the `pgd-proxy` role to that instance in TPAexec's configuration file as shown below before deploying. See [TPAexec](/pgd/latest/deployments/tpaexec) for more information.
```yaml
- Name: proxy-a1
  location: a
  node: 4
  role:
  - pgd-proxy
  volumes:
  - device_name: /dev/sdf
	volume_type: none
```


### Installing manually

You can manually install the PGD Proxy on any Linux machine using `.deb` and `.rpm` packages available from the [BDR repository](https://techsupport.enterprisedb.com/software_subscriptions/add/products/bdr5/). The package name is `edb-pgd5-proxy`. For example:

```sh
# for Debian
sudo apt-get install edb-pgd5-proxy
```

Note: You can install PGD Proxy on any BDR instance in the cluster though it is not recommended.


## Configuration file

Proxy connects to BDR database for its internal operations, like getting proxy configs, getting write leader details, etc. Therefore, it needs a list of endpoints/dsn to connect to BDR nodes. Proxy always tries to connect to the first endpoint in the list, if it fails it tries the next endpoint and so on. The
following is a functional example of `pgd-proxy-config.yml` file:

```yaml
cluster:
  name: my_pgd_cluster
  endpoints:
    - "host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=pgdproxy "
    - "host=bdr-a3 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=pgdproxy "
    - "host=bdr-a2 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=pgdproxy "
  proxy:
    name: "proxy-a1"
```

The `cluster.endpoints` and `cluster.proxy.name` are mandatory fields in the config file.

PGD Proxy searches for `pgd-proxy-config.yml` in the following locations (precedence order - higher to lower):

   1. "-f config-file" (e.g. 'pgd-proxy -f /opt/my-config.yml')
   2. "/etc/edb/pgd-proxy" (default)
   3. "$HOME/.edb/pgd-proxy"

The `pgd-proxy-config.yml`, is located in the `/etc/edb/pgd-proxy` directory, by default. If you rename the file or move it to another location, specify the new name and location using the `-f` flag in the `pgd-proxy.service` file.

The password for the database user which is given in the endpoint should be configured properly on the proxy machine using ~/.pgpass file. If it uses certificate based authentication or any other auth mechanism then required configuration should be done accordingly including any other changes required in pg_hba.conf. If the PGD Cluster is created by TPAexec, the default configuration file is generated automatically, but with a manual installation to a EDB Postgres Distributed cluster you need to create the config file and setup authentication manually.


### Sample with sslpassword support (if certificate based authentication is used).

```yaml
log-level: debug
cluster:
  name: my_pgd_cluster
  endpoints:
  - "host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=pgdproxy sslcert='bdr_client.crt' sslkey='bdr_client.key' sslmode='verify-full' sslrootcert='root.crt' sslpassword='my_encrypted_key_psw' "
  - "host=bdr-b1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=pgdproxy sslcert='bdr_client.crt' sslkey='bdr_client.key' sslmode='verify-full' sslrootcert='root.crt' sslpassword='my_encrypted_key_psw' "
  - "host=bdr-c1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=pgdproxy sslcert='bdr_client.crt' sslkey='bdr_client.key' sslmode='verify-full' sslrootcert='root.crt' sslpassword='my_encrypted_key_psw' "
  proxy:
	name: proxy-a1
```

### Sample with obfuscated sslpassword support (if certificate based authentication is used and sslpassword is not in plain text).

```yaml
log-level: debug
cluster:
  name: my_pgd_cluster
  endpoints:
  - "host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=pgdproxy sslcert='bdr_client.crt' sslkey='bdr_client.key' sslmode='verify-full' sslrootcert='root.crt' sslpassword='my_obfuscated_psw' "
  - "host=bdr-b1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=pgdproxy sslcert='bdr_client.crt' sslkey='bdr_client.key' sslmode='verify-full' sslrootcert='root.crt' sslpassword='my_obfuscated_psw' "
  - "host=bdr-c1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=pgdproxy sslcert='bdr_client.crt' sslkey='bdr_client.key' sslmode='verify-full' sslrootcert='root.crt' sslpassword='my_obfuscated_psw' "
  ssl:
	ssl_password_command: echo my_deobfuscated_psw
  proxy:
	name: proxy-a1
```


## PGD Proxy service file

PGD Proxy is preferably run as a systemd service. Following is the sample service file for EDB Postgres Extended Server and Postgres Community.

Note: For EDB Postgres Advanced Server please change User and Group from `postgres` to `enterprisedb`.

```
[Unit]
Description=PGD Proxy

[Service]
Type=simple
User=postgres
Group=postgres
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=1s
ExecStart=/usr/bin/pgd-proxy -f /etc/edb/pgd-proxy/pgd-proxy-config.yml
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=pgd-proxy

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```


## Managing PGD Proxy

PGD CLI provides few commands viz., `create-proxy`, `show-proxy`, `set-proxy-options` and `delete-proxy` to manage Proxies in PGD cluster. See [PGD CLI](/pgd/latest/cli/command_ref) for more information.
