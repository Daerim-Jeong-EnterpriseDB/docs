title: Installing MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper on SLES 15 x86_64
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Log in as a superuser:

  ```shell
  sudo su -
  ```

- Install the MySQL community repository

  ```shell
  wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-sles12-5.noarch.rpm
  rpm --import /etc/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022
  ```

- Enable the MySQL8 repository and disable the MySQL 5 repository

  ```shell
  zypper modifyrepo -e mysql80-community
  zypper modifyrepo -d mysql57-community
  ```

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the screen instructions.

  Instructions for installing the package are also available from the repository. If you need additional information about running the install command or initial configuration, refer back to this topic.

## Install the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-as<xx>-mysql<y>-fdw
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced server and `<y>` is the version of MySQL to be installed. For example if EDB Postgres Version is 13 and MySQL version is 8 then the package name is `edb-as13-mysql8-fdw`.
