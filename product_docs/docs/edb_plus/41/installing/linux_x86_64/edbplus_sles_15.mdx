## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.
  To determine if your repository exists, enter this command:

  `dnf repolist | grep enterprisedb`

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repo. Depending on your subscription level, you may be able to access two generations of EDB repos. EDB Repos 2.0 provides the most recent instructions.

  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

  Alternatively, you can set up the PostgreSQL community repository instead of the EDB repository. To set up the PostgreSQL community repository, go to [yum](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/) or [apt](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt).

- Activate the required SUSE module

  ```shell
  sudo SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.4/x86_64

  ```

- Refresh the metadata
  ```shell
  sudo zypper refresh
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo zypper -n install edb-edbplus
```

## Initial configuration

After performing a Linux installation of EDB\*Plus, you must set the values of environment variables that allow EDB\*Plus to locate your Java installation:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME=<path_to_java>
export PATH=<path_to_java>/bin:$PATH
```
