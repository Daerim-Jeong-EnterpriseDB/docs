title: Installing EDB*Plus on SLES 15 ppc64le
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Log in as a superuser:

  ```shell
  sudo su -
  ```

- Install Java (version 1.8 or later) on your server, if not present.

  ```shell
  zypper -y install java
  ```

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the screen instructions.

  Instructions for installing the package are also available from the repository. If you need additional information about running the install command or initial configuration, refer back to this topic.

## Install the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-as<xx>-edbplus
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server. For example, if you are installing with version 14 of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the package name would be `edb-as14-edbplus`.

## Initial configuration

After performing a Linux installation of EDB\*Plus, you must set the values of environment variables that allow EDB\*Plus to locate your Java installation:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME=<path_to_java>
export PATH=<path_to_java>/bin:$PATH
```
