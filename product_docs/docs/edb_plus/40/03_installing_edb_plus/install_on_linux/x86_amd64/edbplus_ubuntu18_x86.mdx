title: Installing EDB*Plus on Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Install Java (version 1.8 or later) on your server, if not present.

  ```shell
  sudo apt-get -y install java
  ```

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Address other prerequisites

  ```shell
  #  Add support for secure APT repositories:
  sudo apt-get -y install apt-transport-https

  #  Add the EDB signing key. Substitute your EnterpriseDB credentials
  #  for the '<USERNAME>' and '<PASSWORD>' placeholders.
  wget -q -O - https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key  | sudo apt-key add -

  #  Update the repository metadata:
  sudo apt-get update
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo apt-get install edb-as<xx>-edbplus
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server. For example, if you are installing with version 14 of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the package name would be `edb-as14-edbplus`.

## Initial configuration

After performing a Linux installation of EDB\*Plus, you must set the values of environment variables that allow EDB\*Plus to locate your Java installation:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME=<path_to_java>
export PATH=<path_to_java>/bin:$PATH
```
