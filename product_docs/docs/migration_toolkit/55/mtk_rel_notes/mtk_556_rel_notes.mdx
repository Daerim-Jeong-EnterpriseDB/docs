| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enhancement  | Migration Toolkit now provides two new command options to let you exclude a subset of objects during migration. The `-excludeTables` option skips a subset of tables when all tables are selected for migration, and the `-excludeViews` option skips a subset of views when all views are selected for migration. |
| Bug fix | Fixed the issue where a data migration fails when Migration Toolkit attempts to drop a system generated index. Any system generated indexes are now skipped from removal. [Support ticket: #90282] |
| Bug fix | Fixed the issue where a data migration fails with “Invalid LOB locator specified” error when migrating an Oracle table with an `XMLTYPE` column. [Support ticket: #92284] |
| Bug fix | When performing a data only migration from SQL Server, if the source table contains a `LOB` type column then data is migrated using JDBC batch mode, in which case the `TRUNCATE` is always applied on the target table. This behavior is now corrected so that TRUNCATE is applied only when the user has specified the `truncLoad` option. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue where the JDBC drivers are no longer bundled with Migration Toolkit packages, however the EDB JDBC driver was bundled in the Migration Toolkit package for Debian. |
