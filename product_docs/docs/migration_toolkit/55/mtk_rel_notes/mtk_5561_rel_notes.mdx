| Enhancement  | Updated the table-level parallel loading capability to reduce the overhead on the source database by using range-based criterion for loading each individual table data chunk instead of a fetch-offset approach. This optimization is applicable when the table primary key/unique constraint is based on a non-composite numeric type attribute. |
| Bug fix | Fixed the issue where a data migration fails when Migration Toolkit attempts to drop a system generated index. Any system generated indexes are now skipped from removal. [Support ticket: #90282] |
| Bug fix | Fixed the issue where a data migration fails with `Invalid LOB locator specified` error when migrating an Oracle table with an `XMLTYPE` column. [Support ticket: #92284] |
| Bug fix | Fixed the issue where a `TRUNCATE` is always applied on the target database when performing a data only migration from SQL Server if the source table contains a LOB type column. This behavior is now corrected so that `TRUNCATE` only is applied when the user has specified the `-truncLoad` option. |
| Bug fix | Updated the Migration Toolkit packaging for Debian so that the JDBC drivers are no longer bundled with Migration Toolkit to make it consistent with the packaging for the other OS platforms supported by Migration Toolkit. |
