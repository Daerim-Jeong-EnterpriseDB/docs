navTitle: Debian 10
title: Installing Migration Toolkit on Debian 10 x86_64
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Other prerequisites

  ```shell
  #  Add support for secure APT repositories:
  sudo apt-get -y install apt-transport-https

  #  Add the EDB signing key. Substitute your EnterpriseDB credentials
  #  for the '<USERNAME>' and '<PASSWORD>' placeholders.
  wget -q -O - https://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key  | sudo apt-key add -

  #  Update the repository metadata:
  sudo apt-get update
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo apt-get install edb-migrationtoolkit
```

## Initial configuration

Before invoking Migration Toolkit, you must download and install a freely available source-specific driver. To download a driver, or for a link to a vendor download site, see the [Third Party JDBC Drivers](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres#third-party-jdbc-drivers) on the Downloads page.

After downloading the source-specific driver, move the driver file into the `<mtk_install_dir>/lib` directory.
