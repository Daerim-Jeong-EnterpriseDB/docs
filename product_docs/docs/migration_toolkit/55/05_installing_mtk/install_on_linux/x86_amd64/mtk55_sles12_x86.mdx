---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Install Java (version 1.8 or later) on your server, if not present.

  ```shell
  sudo zypper -y install java
  ```

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository
# credentials when prompted
sudo zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access
# to SUSE repositories
sudo zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE
# registration information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

# Activate the required SUSE module
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64

# Refresh the metadata
sudo zypper refresh
```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo zypper -n install edb-migrationtoolkit
```

## Initial configuration

Before invoking Migration Toolkit, you must download and install a freely available source-specific driver. To download a driver, or for a link to a vendor download site, see the [Third Party JDBC Drivers](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres#third-party-jdbc-drivers) on the Downloads page.

After downloading the source-specific driver, move the driver file into the `<mtk_install_dir>/lib` directory.
