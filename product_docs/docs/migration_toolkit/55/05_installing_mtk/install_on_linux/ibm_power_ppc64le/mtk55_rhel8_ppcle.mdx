Before you begin the installation process, log in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

## Set up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step. If you do need to set up the repository, you must register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

```shell
# Set up the EDB repository:
dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

#  Replace '<USERNAME>' and '<PASSWORD>' below with
#  your username and password for the EDB repository:
sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo

#  Install the EPEL repository:
dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

# Refresh the cache:
dnf makecache

#  Enable additional repositories to resolve dependencies:
ARCH=$( /bin/arch ) subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"

#  Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:
dnf -qy module disable postgresql
```

## Install the package

```shell
dnf -y install edb-migrationtoolkit
```

## Initial configuration

Before invoking Migration Toolkit, you must download and install a freely available source-specific driver. To download a driver, or for a link to a vendor download site, see the [Third Party JDBC Drivers](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres#third-party-jdbc-drivers) on the Downloads page.

After downloading the source-specific driver, move the driver file into the `<mtk_install_dir>/lib` directory.
