You can upgrade an existing Linux installation by first upgrading the `edb.repo` file, which enables access to the current EnterpriseDB repository, and then upgrading Migration Toolkit.

To upgrade the `edb.repo` file:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y upgrade edb-repo
```

Where `<package-manager>` is the package manager used with your operating system:

  | Package manager |             Operating system     |
  | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
  | yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
  | zypper          | SLES                             |
  | apt-get         | Debian and Ubuntu                |


To upgrade Migration Toolkit:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y edb-migrationtoolkit
```
