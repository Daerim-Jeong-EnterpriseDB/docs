title: "Access key"

Access key is a new authentication process for the BigAnimal users to access the BigAnimal API directly without the `OAuth2` authorization flow. The Access key links to one user only. Each Access key link is immutable since its creation. Each Access Key has an expiration time from one to twelve months (365 days), as customized by users.

An Access key belongs to one organization only. Access key can be assigned to a machine user or to a normal user. A normal user can't use its Access key across the organizations. It is managed by an organization owner for the machine user whereas the normal user manages its own Access key links.  Once it expires, users have to create a new key. Also, the user has to create new Access key and drop the one if it is lost.

You can have one Access key per normal user and maximum two Access keys linked per machine user to avoid the interruption of running automation jobs during an **Access Key rotation**.

Access key can be revoked from a user. Revoking the key doesn't impact the role or the other authentication process of the linked user.

## Create Access key

To create an access key:
1. Login to BigAnimal portal.

Copy and save this Access Key in a secure location. The Access key is available only at the time you create it. If you lose your Access key, you must delete the Access key and create a new one.

## Using Access key

The BigAnimal API detects if the caller is using an Access key in the request. If it uses the Access key, further it checks - the validity of the key, the user requesting access from which organization, the user permissions, and then authorizes the access. For more information, see [Using the BigAnimal API](../api.mdx).
