title: "Access key"

Access key is an authentication process for the BigAnimal users to access the BigAnimal API directly without the `OAuth2` authorization flow. The access key links to one user only. Each access key link is immutable since its creation. Each access key has an expiration time from 1 to 365 days, as customized by you.

An access key belongs to one organization only. Access key can be created for a [machine user](../../administering_cluster/01_portal_access/#machine-users) or for a normal user. A normal user can't use its access key across the organizations. It is managed by an organization owner for the machine user whereas the normal user manages own access key. Once it expires, you have to create a new key. Also, you have to create new access key and drop the one if it is lost.

You can have one access key per normal user and maximum two access keys linked per machine user to avoid the interruption of running automation jobs during an **access key rotation**.

Access key can be revoked from a user. Revoking the key doesn't impact the role or the other authentication process of the linked user.

## Create your personal access key

To create an access key:
1. Login to BigAnimal portal.
1. Go to **Access Key** from the menu next to your organization name in the top right of the portal.
1. Select **Create New Key** from the access keys page.
1. Provide the **Access Key Name**.
1. Provide the **Expiry days** in the range of 1 to 365.
1. It provides the generated **Access Key** for the user. 

Copy and save this access key in a secure location. The access key is available only at the time you create it. If you lose your access key, you must delete the access key and create a new one. 

## Manage Access key

You can manage the access keys for a particular user from **Users** home page. 

1. Go to **Users Management** from the menu next to your organization name in the top right of the portal.
1. Select the **Username** from the list.
1. View the **Access Keys** tab on the user's home page. Each row provides the Access key details:
   - **Name** - Access key name
   - **Access Key** - Access key in half encrypted format.
   - **Expiry at** - The expiry date for the Access key.
   - **Create at** - The creation date for the Access Key.
1. To delete a specific key, select **delete** button corresponding to each key. It asks for confirmation before deletion of the key.
1. To create a key, select **Create New Key** at the top right corner.

## Using Access key

The BigAnimal API detects if the caller is using an access key in the request. If it uses the access key, further it checks - the validity of the key, the user requesting access from which organization, the user permissions, and then authorizes the access. For more information, see [Using the BigAnimal API](../api.mdx).
