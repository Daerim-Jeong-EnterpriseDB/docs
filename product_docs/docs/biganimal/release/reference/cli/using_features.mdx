## Using IAM authentication on AWS

To create a cluster that is enabled for IAM authentication, set the `--iam-authentication` flag on the create-cluster command or in the configuration file to `Yes` or `true`, respectively.

To change the IAM authentication setting after creating a cluster, use the `--iam-authentication` flag on the `update-cluster` command. 

To change the IAM authentication setting when restoring a cluster, use the `--iam-authentication` flag on the `restore-cluster` command.
