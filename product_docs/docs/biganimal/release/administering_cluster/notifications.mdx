## Configuring notifications

The project owners/editors and organization owners/admins can configure the notifications for the events visible to them. They can choose if they want to receive notifications in the in-app inbox, email or both. They can also configure email notifications for their teams within their organization. 

Project level notifications are configured within the project.

Notification settings made by a user are applicable only to that user. If an email notification is enabled, the email is sent to the email address associated with the user's login. 

## Viewing notifications

Users in the following roles can view the notifications:
- Organization owners/admins can view the organization-level notifications. 
- Project owners/editors can view the project-level notifications.
- Account owner can view the account-level notifications. 

Each notification indicates the level and/or project it belongs to for the user having multiple roles within BigAnimal.

Select the bell icon on the top of your BigAnimal portal to view the in-app notifications. On the bell icon, you can read the notification, mark it as unread and also archive the notification.

Check the inbox of your configured email addresses, to view the email notifications.
