title: Notifications 
---

With BigAnimal, you can opt to get specific types of notifications and receive both in-app and email notifications.

Different types of events are sent as notifications. These notifications are set at different levels, and users with different roles can configure these notifications. This table provides the list of events sent as notifications grouped by the levels at which they can be set.

| Level        | Event                                                                                            | Role                             | Subscription type    |

## Configuring notifications

The project owners/editors and organization owners/admins can configure the notifications for the events visible to them. They can choose if they want to receive notifications in the in-app inbox, by email, or both. They can also configure email notifications for their teams in their organization. 

Project-level notifications are configured in the project.

Notification settings made by a user apply only to that user. If an email notification is enabled, the email is sent to the email address associated with the user's login.

## Viewing notifications

Users in the following roles can view the notifications:
- Organization owners/admins can view the organization-level notifications. 
- Project owners/editors can view the project-level notifications.
- Account owners can view their own account-level notifications. 

Each notification indicates the level and project it belongs to for the user having multiple roles in BigAnimal.

Select the bell at the top of your BigAnimal portal to view the in-app notifications. By selecting the bell, you can read the notification, mark it as unread, and archive it.

To view the email notifications, check the inbox of your configured email addresses.

## Manage notifications

To manage the notifications: 
1. Log in to the BigAnimal portal.
1. From the menu under your name in the top-right panel, select **My Account**. 
1. Select the **Notifications** tab. Notifications are grouped by organizations and projects available to you.
1. Select any specific organization/project to manage the notifications.
   - Enable/disable the notification for a particular event using the toggle.
   - Select **Email** and **Inbox** next to an event to enable/disable the email and in-app notifications for the event.
