## Configuring notifications

The project owners/editors and organization owners/admins can configure the notifications for the events visible to them. They can choose if they want to receive notifications in the in-app inbox or email or both. They can also configure email notifications for their teams within their organization. 


Project level notifications are to be configured for a project.

Notification settings made by a user is applicable only to that user. If an email notification is enabled, the email is sent to the email address associated with their login. 

Notifications related to unused features for an organization or a project aren't visible or configurable in the UI.
