Projects are a group of database clusters within a BigAnimal organization. Access to Projects is controlled by a user's role. With Projects, you can separate workflows to provide secure and isolated environments and assign different users to different Projects. See [Managing portal access](/biganimal/release/administering_cluster/01_portal_access) for more information.

Projects actions are available from the left navigation bar. The actions apply to the Project in focus. You can switch between Projects using the Projects menu.

## Adding a user to a Project
Before adding a user to a Project: 
- The user must be added to the organization through the organization's identity provider.

- The user must log in to the BigAnimal portal at least once.
- You must be an organization owner or the project owner of the Project.

To add a user: 
1. Select the Project you want to add a user to from the Projects menu.

1. Select Users from the left navigation bar.
2.  Select the edit icon for the user.
3.  Select **Assign Roles**.
4.  Depending on the level of access you want for the user, select the appropriate role.

5.  Select **Submit**.


## Creating a Project

Before creating a new Project: 

- You must have an organization owner role.

- You must create a new Azure subscription or AWS account to create a new Project. 

  - To create a new Azure subscription, see [Create a Microsoft Customer Agreement subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription).

  - To create a new AWS account, see [Creating an AWS account in your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html).

  !!!noteNotes
     - You can only use a single Azure subscription or AWS account for one Project at a time. For example, if you have two Projects and only need to deploy your clusters in AWS, you need to connect a different AWS account for each Project.

     - To reuse an Azure subscription or AWS account, you have to first delete the Project that was previously connected with that account.

To create a new Project:

1. On the Projects menu, select **New Project**.

1. Enter a unique name for the Project.
1. Select **Create Project**.
1. Select **Project > See All Projects**.
1. Select your new project.
1. Set up the cloud provider for the Project. See [Connecting your cloud](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/02_connecting_to_your_cloud/).
1. Activate the region for the Project. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions/).
1. Select **Create Project**.
