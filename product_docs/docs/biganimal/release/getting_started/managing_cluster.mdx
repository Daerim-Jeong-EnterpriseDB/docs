## Pausing and resuming clusters

Pausing a cluster allows you to save on compute costs without losing data or cluster configuration settings. There is no additional cost for paused clusters, although you must still pay for any disk and object storage that the paused cluster requires. The ability to pause clusters gives you the flexibility to configure applications that don't separate storage and computing. You can use the BigAnimal API or CLI to pause and resume clusters, which allows you to schedule pauses.

Pausing a cluster drops all existing actions on the cluster, blocks future actions such as editing the cluster, and stops monitoring. While paused, you cannot make or maintain connections, or read, write, or edit cluster settings. Automatic backups are paused. However, backups taken while the cluster was running remain until their retention period expires. While paused, clusters are not upgraded or patched, but upgrades are applied as part of the reactivation process.

Pausing a high availability or Postgres Distributed cluster shuts down all cluster nodes. Faraway replicas are paused independently of their source cluster, which means you can choose to pause the source cluster and continue running the faraway replica to serve read-only workloads.

After seven days, single node and high availability clusters automatically reactivate at the next scheduled maintenance window. 
Postgres Distributed clusters automatically reactivate after seven days.

Resuming a cluster applies any pending maintenance upgrades. Monitoring begins again. You can also begin to edit existing connections and make new connections. 

### Pausing a cluster

1.  Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page in the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com). 
2.  To pause the cluster, do one of the following:
    -   In the row for the cluster, at right, select the ellipsis icon and then select **Pause Cluster**.
    -   Select the cluster you want to pause. From **Quick Actions** on the cluster details page, select **Pause Cluster**.
3.  Confirm that you want to pause the cluster. When the process finishes, Cluster Info shows the cluster is paused.

### Resuming a cluster

1.  Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page in the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com). 
2.  To resume the cluster, do one of the following:
    -   In the row for the cluster, at right, select the ellipsis icon and then select **Resume Cluster**.
    -   Select the cluster you want to resume. From **Quick Actions** on the cluster details page, select **Resume Cluster**.
3.  Confirm that you want to resume the cluster. When the process finishes, Cluster Info shows the cluster is in a healthy state.
