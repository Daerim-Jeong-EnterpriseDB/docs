## Pausing a cluster

Pausing a cluster allows you to save on compute costs without losing data or a cluster's configuration.

Pausing a cluster drops all existing actions on the cluster, blocks future actions such as editing the cluster, and stops monitoring. After seven days, the cluster automatically resumes.

1.  Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page in the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com). 
2.  To pause the cluster, do one of the following:
    -   In the row for the cluster, at right, select the ellipsis icon and then select **Pause Cluster**.
    -   Select the cluster you want to pause. From **Quick Actions** on the cluster details page, select **Pause Cluster**.
3.  Confirm that you want to pause the cluster. When the process finishes, Cluster Info shows the cluster is paused.

## Resuming a cluster

Resuming a cluster applies any pending maintenance upgrades, allows editing and new connections, and resumes monitoring. 

1.  Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page in the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com). 
2.  To resume the cluster, do one of the following:
    -   In the row for the cluster, at right, select the ellipsis icon and then select **Resume Cluster**.
    -   Select the cluster you want to resume. From **Quick Actions** on the cluster details page, select **Resume Cluster**.
3.  Confirm that you want to resume the cluster. When the process finishes, Cluster Info shows the cluster is in a healthy state.
