## Connecting your cloud

!!! tip
    If you're using Cloud Shell, add the `./` prefix to the `biganimal` command (`./biganimal`).
    
To connect your cloud:

1. Open the Google Cloud Shell in your browser.

1.  Create a BigAnimal CLI credential:

   ```shell
   biganimal credential create --name <cred> 
   ```

1. To set up your cloud provider, run the `setup-csp` command:

   ```shell
    biganimal cloud-provider setup  
   ```
   The command checks for cloud account readiness and displays the results. 

1. If the following readiness checks aren't met for your cloud service provider, see [Configure your Google Cloud account](/biganimal/release/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/preparing_gcp/#configure-your-aws-account) to manually configure your cloud:

   - Is the Google Cloud CLI configured to access your Google Cloud account?

   - Is the limit on the number of vCPUs and network load balancers (NLBs) in your region enough for your clusters?

   If the cloud readiness checks pass, your cloud account is successfully set up. 
   
1.  Connect your cloud account to BigAnimal:

   ```shell
   biganimal cloud-provider connect --provider gcp --project <project-name>
   ```
 After your cloud account is successfully connected to BigAnimal, you and other users with the correct permissions can create clusters.
