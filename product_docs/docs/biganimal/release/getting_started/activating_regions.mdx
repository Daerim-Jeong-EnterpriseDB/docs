title: "Activating regions"

---

When you activate a region, BigAnimal prepares the infrastructure required to deploy clusters. You must activate a cloud region before creating clusters in that region.

## Prerequisite

Your cloud service provider (CSP) must be set up with BigAnimal, see [Setting up your identity provider](../getting_started/identity_provider/)

## Activate a new region

1. On the left panel, under Admin, select **Regions**.

1. A list of previously activated regions appears. Select **Activate New Region**. (Skip this step if this is your first time activating regions in your BigAnimal account.)
 
1. Select the cloud service provider (CSP) of the regions you want to activate. A list of regions associated with the CSP appears.

1. Select the regions you want to activate. You can activate multiple regions where you plan on adding clusters. 

1. Select **Activate Region(s)**.
 
BigAnimal might take a while to provision the infrastructure for a region. You can select a region for deploying your cluster even if it is not yet *Active*. Your cluster creation request is added to a queue, and the cluster will be created after your region is activated.
