title: "Activating regions"

---

When you activate a region, BigAnimal prepares the infrastructure required to deploy clusters. You must activate a cloud region before creating clusters in that region.

!!! Note
    Activating a new region can increase your cloud costs.

## Prerequisite

Your cloud service provider (CSP) must be set up with BigAnimal, see [Setting up your identity provider](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/identity_provider/).

## Activate a new region

!!! Note
    BigAnimal might take a while to provision the infrastructure for a region. You can select a region for deploying your cluster even if it is not yet *Active*. Your cluster creation request is added to a queue, and the cluster is created after your region is activated.

1. On the left panel, under Admin, select **Regions**.

1. This step is dependent on whether you already have active regions or not:
   - If this is your first time activating regions, you can directly move to the next step.
   - If you already have regions activated, a list of previously activated regions appears. Select **Activate New Region**.
     
1. Select the cloud service provider (CSP) of the regions you want to activate. A list of regions associated with the CSP appears.

1. Select the regions you want to activate. You can activate multiple regions where you plan on adding clusters. 

1. Select **Activate Region(s)**.
