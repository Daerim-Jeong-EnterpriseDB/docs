Tags are key-value pairs you can apply to your resources for fine-grained access control and granular cost data at the bucket level.

Tags are created at the project level and managed through the Cloud Service, which is used across your cloud region.

## Create Tags

To create a tag:

1. Log in to the Console.
    
1. Go to project's page.
1. In the project's list, select your **Project**.
1. On your project's home page left navigation, select **Cloud Providers**.
1. On the cloud provider's page, select **Your Cloud Account**.
1. On your cloud account tab under **AWS**, select **Manage Tags**.
1. Select **Add a Key Value pair**.
1. Provide **Key** and **Value** and select **Save**.
1.  A **Confirm changes to AWS tags** message pops-up.
1.  Select **Confirm** to add the tag.
1.  This **Key:Value** pair is added at your project-level. It is inherited by all the resources in your project including regions and clusters.

This new tag appears in the list under **AWS** on Cloud Service Providers . 

This tag is also added to the tags on the AWS Console. You can view this tag in the **Tags** tab of your EC2 instance resources on AWS console.

### Considerations

Consider following while adding a **Key:Value** pair:

- If you add a **Key:Value** pair or only **Key** in the **Key** field it is accepted.

- The **Key** value must be unique within your project.
- The Key cannot have **aws**, **managedby** in the prefix.
- The maximum length for Key is 127 characters and for value is 255 characters.
