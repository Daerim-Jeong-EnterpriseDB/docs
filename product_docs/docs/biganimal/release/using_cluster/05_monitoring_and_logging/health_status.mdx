title: "Health Status"
---

Health Status dashboard provides the status of the Postgres high-availability clusters. It provides status for both Primary/Standby and Distributed high-availability clusters.

Health Status dashboard displays:
- A set of cluster-wide health indicators that helps to draw your attention immediately to the critical issues.
- A schematic view of all the nodes organized in a cluster distributed across regions displaying health and role(s) of each node.
- A replication status view displaying the status of each replication slot and the associated replication lags.

## Viewing Health Status dashboard

To view the **Health Status** dashboard from the BigAnimal portal:

1. In the left navigation of BigAnimal Portal, go to **Clusters**.
2. Select any ready cluster.
3. On the cluster detail page, select the **Health Status** tab.

The **Health Status** tab displays the dashboard with health status categorized in sections:
- [Viewing Health Status dashboard](#viewing-health-status-dashboard)
  - [Global cluster health](#global-cluster-health)
  - [Regional nodes health and roles](#regional-nodes-health-and-roles)
  - [Replication status](#replication-status)

### Global cluster health

The global cluster health section displays the cluster-wide view including the following metrics:

- **Raft Status** (PGD only)&mdash; It indicates whether the Raft consensus algorithm is running correctly in the cluster. It verifies that one node is elected as the global leader and the Raft roles such as RAFT_LEADER and RAFT_FOLLOWER are defined correctly across all the nodes.
- **Replication Slots Status** (PGD only)&mdash; It indicates whether all the replication slots are in streaming state or not.
- **Clock Skew**&mdash; It indicates whether the node's clock is in sync and doesn't exceed a threshold of 60 seconds.
- **Proxy Status** (PGD only)&mdash; It provides the number of PGD proxies up over the ones available.????
- **Node Status**&mdash; It provides the number of nodes that are up and running.
- **Transaction rate**&mdash; It provides the total number of transactions including committed and rolled back transactions per second in the cluster.
