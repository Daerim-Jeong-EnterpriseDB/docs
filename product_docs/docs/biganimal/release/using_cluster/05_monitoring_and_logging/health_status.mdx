title: "Health Status"
---

The Health Status dashboard provides real-time insight into the topology and health of Postgres high-availability clusters. It supports both Primary/Standby and Distributed high-availability clusters.

The Health Status dashboard displays:
- A set of cluster-wide health indicators that helps to draw your attention immediately to the critical issues.
- A schematic view of all the nodes organized in a cluster distributed across regions displaying health and role(s) of each node.
- A replication status view displaying the status of each replication slot and the associated replication lags.

## Viewing Health Status dashboard

To view the **Health Status** dashboard from the BigAnimal portal:

1. In the left navigation of BigAnimal Portal, go to **Clusters**.
2. Select any ready high-availability or PGD cluster.
3. On the cluster detail page, select the **Health Status** tab.

The **Health Status** tab displays the dashboard with health status categorized in sections:
- [Viewing Health Status dashboard](#viewing-health-status-dashboard)
  - [Global cluster health](#global-cluster-health)
  - [Regional nodes health and roles](#regional-nodes-health-and-roles)
  - [Replication status](#replication-status)

### Global cluster health

The global cluster health section displays the cluster-wide view including the following metrics:

- **Raft Status** (PGD only)&mdash; It indicates whether the Raft consensus algorithm is running correctly in the cluster. It verifies that one node is elected as the global leader and the Raft roles such as RAFT_LEADER and RAFT_FOLLOWER are defined correctly across all the nodes.
- **Replication Slot Status** (PGD only)&mdash; It indicates whether all the replication slots are in streaming state or not.
- **Clock Skew**&mdash; It indicates whether the node's clock is in sync and doesn't exceed a threshold of 60 seconds.
- **Proxy Status** (PGD only)&mdash; It provides the number of PGD proxies up and running as compared to the available proxies.
- **Node Status**&mdash; It provides the number of nodes that are up and running.
- **Transaction rate**&mdash; It provides the total number of transactions including committed and rolled back transactions per second in the cluster.


### Regional nodes health and roles

The regional nodes health and roles section displays fine-grained health status at regional and node level. It is structured as an accordion, with each element representing a group of nodes deployed in the same region. Each item displays basic information including:
- **Proxy Status** (only PGD)&mdash; It indicates the number of active proxies compared to the available proxies in the specified regions.
- **Node Status** &mdash; The number of nodes up and running as compared to the available nodes in the specified region in a text chart. It provides the status of all nodes in the specified region using boolean indicator (green (OK)/red (KO)) in a text chart.

On expanding each item, it provides a list nodes with information like:
- Total number of active connections as compared to the maximum number of configured connections for each node.
- Memory usage percentage on a progress bar.
- Storage usage percentage on a progress bar.

For PGD, it provides the tags below the node name:
- **Raft Leader**&mdash; It indicates that the node is a Raft Leader locally in the region.
- **Raft Follower**&mdash; It indicates that the node is a Raft Follower locally in the region. 
- **Global Raft Leader**&mdash; It indicates that the nodes is a Raft Leader globally in the cluster.
- **Global Raft Follower**&mdash; It indicates that the node is a Raft Follower globally in the cluster.
- **Witness**&mdash; It indicates that the node is a witness in the PGD cluster. See [witness node docs](/pgd/latest/node_management/witness_nodes/) for more information.

For high-availability, it provides the tags below the node name:
- **Primary**&mdash; It indicates if the node role is primary.

### Replication status

The Replication Status section has a matrix displaying the replication lag across all the nodes of the cluster. The matrix provides different types of replication lags for **Write**, **Replay**, **Flush**, and **Sent**. It provides the lag in both bytes and time for **Write**, **Replay**, and **Flush** whereas only in bytes for **Sent**.

!!!note
- In high-availability clusters, replication occurs only from the primary (source) to the replicas (target). So the matrix displays only one row for the source and multiple columns for the targets.
- In PGD clusters, the replications are bidirectional, so the matrix displays an equal number of rows and columns. Every node is both a source and a target.

!!!note
The data on the Health Status dashboard is dynamic and is updated continuously. However, the cluster architecture is based on a snapshot. If a new node is added or an existing node is removed, you must reload the Health Status dashboard by clicking the tab again or reloading the browser page.
