title: "Monitoring and logging"

Upon logging in, PEMx monitoring widgets are shown prominently on the home page or on the project summary page. These widgets are available only for the deployed PostgreSQL clusters and are not available for the clusters in the provisioning process. They provide a high level key information on:
- Memory
- CPU
- Storage usage percentages
- Database size
- Transactions per second

To see more in-depth metrics specific to the PostgreSQL cluster click on any widget on the home page. It redirects to the **Monitoring and Logging** tab of the cluster page.

To view the **Monitoring and Logging** tab from the BigAnimal portal:

1. Go to **Clusters** in the left navigation of BigAnimal portal. 
2. Select any ready cluster. 
3. Select **Monitoring and Logging** tab on the cluster detail page.

The **Monitoring and Logging** tab displays the detailed PEMx monitoring metrics specific to that cluster:

- **Single-stat charts** &mdash; These charts highlights a single specific value based on the last value in the selected time interval. For example, if you choose ``last N``, it displays the current value and for the specific time interval, it displays the value at the end of the selected time interval. These charts display key metrics in text, gauges, or pie and donut form. It provides a concise snapshot of information such as: 
  - **Memory** (Gauge chart) &mdash; Displays the percentage of memory utilized by the node hosting the PostgreSQL cluster.
  - **CPU** (Gauge chart) &mdash; Displays the percentage of CPU utilized for the PostgreSQL cluster.
  - **Storage** (Gauge chart) &mdash; Displays the percentage of the storage volume utilized by the PostgreSQL cluster.
  - **Storage** (Donut chart) &mdash; Displays the units of the storage volume utilized for the PostgreSQL cluster.
  - **Active connections** (Text chart) &mdash; Displays the current number of connections between the client applications and the database.
  - **Disk throughput** (Text chart) &mdash; Displays the amount of data transferred to and from the disk per second.
  - **Transactions per second** (Text chart) &mdash; Displays the total number of transactions executing within a second for the PostgreSQL cluster.
  - **Database size** (Text chart) &mdash; Displays the amount of storage volume utilized by the database.

- **Historical charts** &mdash; It displays the historical data of last 15 minutes by default. To view the historical data of a particular time range, customize the time range using a time range picker. These charts display key metrics in single line and bar or multi line and bar form. It provides a concise snapshot of the information such as:
- **Memory** (Line chart) &mdash; Displays the historical trend of memory usage percentage over a time period.
- **CPU** (Bar chart) &mdash; Displays the historical trend of CPU usage percentage over a time period.
- ** Network activity** (Bar chart) &mdash; Displays the historical data transfer to and from the network card per second, over a time period.
- **Disk IOPS** (Multi0line chart) &mdash; Displays the historical trends in the number of reds, writes, and total operations on the disk per second, over a time period.
- **Transaction per second** (Multi-line chart) &mdash; Displays the historical trends in the number of transactions per second, over a time period.

### Time range picker

On `Monitoring and Logging` tab, to view the historical data of a particular time range configure the time range using:
- the `Last X` combo box
- the date-time picker

The `Last X` combo box provides several time range options in the drop-down list. Each option in the list is enabled only after that much time duration has elapsed since the PostgreSQL cluster is created. The default time range is of 15 minutes and the maximum is `Last 30 days`.

!!! Note
The data on the `Monitoring and Logging` tab is refreshed automatically every 30 seconds when the time range is selected from the `Last X` combo box.

### Information tooltip

Each chart has a information tooltip that provides a detail description of the chart. Hover the mouse over the tooltip icon on the right side of the chart name to view the information.

### Charts error state

A red warning icon is displayed next to the tooltip if there is any error for that chart. If any of the metric exceeds its threshold it results into an error warning. Clicking on this red icon displays a window with description of the error and an `Edit Cluster` button. The `Edit Cluster` button takes to the edit cluster page. Do the configuration changes based on the specific metric that brings the cluster in a healthy state. The table shows list of different errors and the corresponding solutions.

| Error  | Solution |
| ------ | -------- |
| **High CPU** | On the `Edit Cluster` page, select the preferred category, instance series, and the instance size to increase the CPU. |
| **High Memory** | On the `Edit Cluster` page, select the preferred category, instance series, and the instance size to increase the memory size. |
| **High Storage** | On the `Edit Cluster` page, go to cluster settings and increase the volume size to increase the storage. |


### Zooming in/out charts

To zoom in a particular area on the historical chart, drag and select that specific area. To reset, select `Reset zoom` on the three dots icon at the top-right corner of the chart.

### Download CSV

To download the historical chart, go to the three dots icon in the top-right corner of the chart and select the `Download CSV` option from the drop-down list. The download includes only the data currently visible on the chart. To download the different data, configure the time range picker before selecting the `Download CSV` button.
