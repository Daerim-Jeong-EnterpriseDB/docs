Datadog integration is based on the OpenTelemetry Collector and the Datadog plugin bundled with the OpenTelemetry collector. Once enabled, BigAnimal automatically configures data planes to send the Telemetry to your Datadog account via Datadog's cloud receive endpoint.

## Pre-requisites

A pre-existing Datadog account is required to use this integration.

## Enabling Datadog

To enable the **Datadog** integrations: 

1. Select an existing project from the **Projects** page.
2. Go to **Settings** on the left-side navigation.
3. Select **Integrations** from the **Settings** drop down list.
4. Select **Datadog**, a window pops-up to provide the details: 
   - **Datadog API Key** &mdash; Provide an API Key. For more details, see [Datadog API Key](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/). The API Key is sensitive and can't be retrieved once saved.
   - **Datadog Site Name** &mdash; Provide the Datadog site name by selecting from the available options in the drop-down list. The telemetry goes to this chosen Datadog site. 
   - **Datadog Site URL** &mdash; The Datadog site URL gets selected automatically based on the Datadog site name you selected. 
   - **Datadog API Key ID** &mdash; Provide the API Key ID, that acts as the name to store an identifier for the key. This identifier is used for future reference to check the configuration details.
   
   Provide all the details and then select **Save**.

Once you enable this integration, it sends BigAnimal telemetry to your Datadog account.

!!! note "Important"
Generate a new API Key in Datadog to enable this integration in BigAnimal. This API key must be specific to this integration and shouldn't be shared. Whenever you disable this integration, revoke the API Key using the Datadog UI. Once revoked, it disables the Datadog ingestion and billable usage from the BigAnimal integration. This doesn't impact the other services using the Datadog API.
