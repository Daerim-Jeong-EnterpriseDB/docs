Datadog integration is based on the OpenTelemetry Collector and the Datadog plugin bundled with the OpenTelemetry collector. Once enabled, BigAnimal automatically configures data planes to send the Telemetry to your Datadog account via Datadog's cloud receive endpoint.

!!!note
Datadog integration doesn't install the Datadog agent, it sends telemetry to the Datadog API.

## Pre-requisites

A pre-existing Datadog account is required to use this integration.

## Enabling Datadog

To enable the **Datadog** integrations: 

1. Select an existing project from the **Projects** page.
2. Go to **Settings** on the left-side navigation.
3. Select **Integrations** from the **Settings** drop down list.
4. Select **Datadog**, a window pops-up to provide the details: 
   - **Datadog API Key** &mdash; Provide an API Key. For more details, see [Datadog API Key](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/). The API Key is sensitive and can't be retrieved once saved.
   - **Datadog Site Name** &mdash; Provide the Datadog site name by selecting from the available options in the drop-down list. The telemetry goes to this chosen Datadog site. 
   - **Datadog Site URL** &mdash; The Datadog site URL gets selected automatically based on the Datadog site name you selected. 
   - **Datadog API Key ID** &mdash; Provide the API Key ID, that acts as the name to store an identifier for the key. This identifier is used for future reference to check the configuration details.
   
   Provide all the details and then select **Save**.

Once you enable this integration, it sends BigAnimal telemetry to your Datadog account.

!!! note "Important"
Generate a new API Key in Datadog to enable this integration in BigAnimal. This API key must be specific to this integration and shouldn't be shared. Whenever you disable this integration, revoke the API Key using the Datadog UI. Once revoked, it disables the Datadog ingestion and billable usage from the BigAnimal integration. This doesn't impact the other services using the Datadog API.

## Metrics

BigAnimal sends a subset of the OpenTelemetry Collector's metrics from the hostmetrics and kubeletstats receivers, plus BigAnimal custom metrics for the monitored Postgres instance. 

You can see a list of metrics in the Datadog user interface, along with the tags for each metric. 

To see the list of metrics, go to **Metrics > Summary**. Then select a specific metric to see the tags for that metric. 

The set of metrics delivered to DataDog is subject to change. Metrics with names that begin with `postgres.preview.` or `biganimal.preview.` are likely to be renamed or removed in a future release. Other metrics may also be renamed, added, or removed to better integrate into the DataDog platform.

## Cost

After enabling the BigAnimal telemetry integration, check your billable Datadog usage and continue to monitor it over time.

Be aware of the following cost considerations:

* *You are responsible for all costs* charged to your Datadog account by telemetry sent by the BigAnimal Datadog integration. Charges are based on usage but they could even result from BigAnimal errors or oversights. If you do not accept this responsibility, do not enable the Datadog integration.
* Datadog bills for each monitored Postgres node (including any replicas) as a "monitored host" in the your Datadog plan. See the [Datadog price list](https://www.datadoghq.com/pricing/list/) for current pricing per monitored host.
* Datadog *may* bill for each Postgres container and monitoring agent container running on each monitored Postgres node. See the [Datadog price list](https://www.datadoghq.com/pricing/list/) for current pricing per monitored container.
* Datadog counts some of the metrics sent by BigAnimal as custom metrics. Datadog plans include a limited number of free unique custom metrics dimensions per host. Additional metrics dimensions above the free limit are billable at a rate set in the Datadog price list. See your [Datadog plan price list](https://www.datadoghq.com/pricing/list/) for details. Although BigAnimal's telemetry integration for Datadog tries to limit custom metrics delivery to minimize additional billable Datadog usage, you should still expect some billable custom metrics usage.

To disable the Datadog integration for BigAnimal and ensure no further costs are incurred on your Datadog account, you must revoke the API key provided to BigAnimal. Disabling the integration on the BigAnimal Portal is not sufficient.

Currently, Datadog does not offer any mechanism for configuring a usage limit or billing cap for monitored hosts, monitored containers, or custom metrics. The Datadog [metrics without limits feature](https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/metrics-without-limits/) can limit cardinality-based billing for custom metrics, but it enables ingestion-based billing instead, so the overall price may actually be greater. You must actively monitor and be alert to your Datadog usage-based billing using the Datadog-provided [usage metrics](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/billing/usage_metrics/), such as `datadog.estimated_usage.hosts`, `datadog.estimated_usage.containers`, and `datadog.estimated_usage.metrics.custom`.
