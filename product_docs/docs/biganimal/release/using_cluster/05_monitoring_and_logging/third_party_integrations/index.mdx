title: "Third party integrations"

BigAnimal provides support for third-party integrations for monitoring and logging. The third-party tools available in BigAnimal are:

- Datadog
- New relic

The third-party integrations are allowed at the project level. Users can't turn monitoring integrations on or off for the individual clusters. An Org admin or a Project owner can set up an integration. Only one monitoring integration can be set up per project.

By default, all the third-party integrations are disabled. Enable it using the **Integrations** tab after creating the project. All the metrics collected by these tools are displayed in BigAnimal *Monitoring and logging** tab using PEMx. The collected logs are exported to the object storage by default.

The Project Owners, Editors, and Viewers can view the active integrations and can link to the third party service from the BigAnimal UI.

To enable the third-party integrations: 
1. Select an existing project from the **Projects** page.
2. Select the **Settings** gear next to the project.
3. Go to **Integrations** tab
4. Select any one of the available integrations:
   - **Datadog** - If you select Datadog, a window pops-up. Provide the **Datadog API Key**, the **site URL** and select save.
   - **New Relic** - It you select New Relic, a window pops-up. Provide the *New Relic API key**, the **other** details and select the **Test Connection**. If the connection test is successful, then select save.
