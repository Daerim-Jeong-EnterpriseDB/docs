title: "Third-party monitoring integrations"
---

BigAnimal provides support for third-party monitoring integrations for using both your own account and BigAnimal's cloud account.

Monitoring integrations are configured at the project level in BigAnimal. You can't turn these integrations on or off for individual clusters. An admin or a project owner can set up an integration. You can set up only one integration per project.

By default, all the integrations are disabled. After creating the project, enable an integration using the **Integrations** tab.

All the metrics collected from all the clusters in the project are sent to the integrated tool and displayed in the BigAnimal  [**Monitoring and logging** tab using PEMx](../monitoring_using_pemx). The collected logs are exported to the object storage by default.

The third-party integrations available in BigAnimal are:

- [Datadog](./datadog)
- [New Relic](./newrelic)
