The New Relic integration is based on the OpenTelemetry Collector, shipping the metrics over the standard OLTP protocol to the New Relic cloud endpoint.

## Pre-requisites

A pre-existing New Relic account is required to use this integration.

## Enable New Relic

To enable the **New Relic** integration: 
1. Select an existing project from the **Projects** page.
2. Go to **Settings** on the left-side navigation.
3. Select **Integrations** from the **Settings** drop down list.
4. Select **New Relic**, a window pops up to provide the details: 
   - **New Relic API key** - Provide an API Key. For more details, see [New Relic API Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/). The API Key is sensitive and can't be retrieved once saved.
   - **New Relic API Key Name** - Provide the API Key name to store an identifier for the key. This identifier is used for future reference to check the configuration details.
   - **New Relic Account ID** - Provide the account ID of New Relic.
   
   Provide all the details and select **Save**.

Once you enable this integration, it sends BigAnimal telemetry to your New Relic account.

!!! note "Important"
Generate a new API License Key in New Relic to enable this integration in BigAnimal. This API key must be specific to this integration and shouldn't be shared. Whenever you disable this integration, revoke the API Key using the New Relic UI. Once revoked, it disables the New Relic ingestion and billable usage from the BigAnimal integration. This doesn't impact the other services using the New Relic API.
