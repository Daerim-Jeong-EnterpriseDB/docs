title: "Setting real-time alerts in Azure"

---

BigAnimal provides a wide range of metrics for your clusters, see [Metrics](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/05_monitoring_and_logging/metrics/). You can use a Log Analytics query to trigger a real-time alerts based on these metrics. 

For example, in this example we set up an alert that is triggered when one of your cluster groups goes down. Assume that your cluster group has an ID = *p-gjlmcos8n7* and is on a subscription called *development*.
 

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Alerts**. On the Alerts page, you can see the metrics that BigAnimal collects from your environment.

1. Select **+ Create** and select **Alert rule** to create new alert rule.

1. Select **+ Select scope**. Under Select a resource:
    1. Select your Azure subscription (**development**) in the Filter by subscription field. 

    1. Select **Log Analytics workspaces** in the Filter by resource type field.
    1. Select the Azure region of your cluster in the **Filter by location** field. 
    
1. BigAnimal creates a Log Analytics workspace for each region in your Azure subscription. Select the Log Analytics workspace for your region and select **Done** (see right column for region).

1. In the Condition tab, 
   1. Select **Add condition** to set when the alert rule is triggered. 

   1. Select **Custom log search** to monitor the Log analytics service.

1. To trigger an alert when the database cluster is not detected enter the following query:

    ```text
    DpMetrics_CL
    | where Message has "cnp_collector_up"
    | extend m = todynamic(Message)
    | where m.labels.role == "primary" and m.labels.postgresql == "p-gjlmcos8n7"
    ```
     The query programs the alert to check for the *cnp_collector_up* metric for the *p-gjlmcos8n7* database cluster. 

1. After running the query, select **Continue editing alert**.

1. Design the alert logic based on number of results. Under Alert logic:
    1. Select the **Operator** as **Equals to**. 
    1. Enter **0** in the Threshold value field.

     The alert is triggered when the database cluster is unavailable and there are no metrics of *cnp_collector_up*. It can indicate that there is a monitoring problem or a critical error.

1. In the Details tab, create the alert rule name.

1. Select **Review + Create**.

1. Select **Create**.
