## Supported AWS regions 

When using AWS, you can create clusters in the following regions:

| Geographical region |       Cloud region       |   Short name   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| North America (NA)                  | Canada (Central)         | ca-central-1   |
|                   | US East (N. Virginia)    | us-east-1      |
|                 | US East (Ohio)           | us-east-2      |
|                   | US West (Oregon)         | us-west-2      |

|                 | Asia Pacific (Seoul)     | ap-northeast-2 |
|                 | Asia Pacific (Mumbai)    | ap-south-1     |
|                 | Asia Pacific (Singapore) | ap-southeast-1 |
|                 | Asia Pacific (Sydney)    | ap-southeast-2 |




## Next steps

To successfully deploy a cluster, you must activate the region to prepare its cloud infrastructure. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions) for more information.

!!! Tip
    You can select a cloud region for deploying your cluster even if it is not yet *Active*. However, your cluster creation request is added to a queue, and the cluster is created only after you activate the region.
