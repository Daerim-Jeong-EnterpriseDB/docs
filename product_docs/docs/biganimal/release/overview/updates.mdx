title: Periodic maintenance

EDB performs periodic maintenance to ensure stability and security of your clusters. EDB performs minor version upgrades and patch updates as part of this periodic maintenance. You are notified in the BigAnimal portal prior to maintenance occurring. Details are available on the [BigAnimal status page](https://status.biganimal.com/). You can subscribe to get these updates in a feed by selecting **Subscribe to Updates** on the status page. 

EDB reserves the right to upgrade customers to the latest minor version without prior notice in an extraordinary circumstance. You cannot configure minor versions. 

In some cases these updates may terminate existing network connections to your clusters. If that happens, the outage should be very brief - typically less than 30 seconds. Be sure your applications are configured to automatically reconnect when connections are interrupted. Most modern database libraries do this by default. 

## Tips for handling transient connectivity errors

Transient connectivity errors are best handled using retry logic. 

Our recommendation is to:

- Wait for 5 seconds before your first retry.
- For each following retry, the increase the wait exponentially, up to 60 seconds.
- Set a max number of retries at which point your application considers the operation failed.
When a connection with an active transaction fails, it is more difficult to handle the recovery correctly. There are two cases: If the transaction was read-only in nature, it is safe to reopen the connection and to retry the transaction. If however if the transaction was also writing to the database, you must determine if the transaction was rolled back, or if it succeeded before the transient error happened. In that case, you might just not have received the commit acknowledgment from the database server.

One way of doing this, is to generate a unique ID on the client that is used for all the retries. You pass this unique ID as part of the transaction to the server and to store it in a column with a unique constraint. This way you can safely retry the transaction. It will succeed if the previous transaction was rolled back and the client generated unique ID does not yet exist in the system. It will fail indicating a duplicate key violation if the unique ID was previously stored because the previous transaction completed successfully.

When your program communicates with Azure Database for PostgreSQL through third-party middleware, ask the vendor whether the middleware contains retry logic for transient errors.

Make sure to test your retry logic. For example, try to execute your code while scaling up or down the compute resources of your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server. Your application should handle the brief downtime that is encountered during this operation without any problems.
