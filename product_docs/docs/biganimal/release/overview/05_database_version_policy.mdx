title: "Database version policy"
---

We support the major Postgres versions from the date they are made available until the version is retired by EDB (generally five years). See [Platform Compatibility ](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas) for more details on support dates for PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server. See [End of life policy](#end-of-life-policy) for details on our policy for retiring deprecated versions.

## End of life policy

BigAnimal deprecates support for Postgres versions following the same timeline as PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, and EDB Postgres Extended Server follow the same timelines. We recommend that you take action and upgrade your Postgres databases running on the deprecated version to a later version as soon as possible. 

Six months before the PostgreSQL deprecation date BigAnimal won't allow new instances to be created with the deprecated database version. 

Six months after the PostgreSQL deprecation date BigAnimal will force a major version upgrade to all clusters running the deprecated database version.

The only exception will be customers who have purchased Extended Life Support prior to that date. To purchase Extended Life Support, reach out to EDB Sales.
