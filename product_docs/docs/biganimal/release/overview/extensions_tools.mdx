BigAnimal supports a number of Postgres extensions and tools, which you can install on or along side your cluster.

## Postgres extensions

- See [Postgres extensions available by deployment](/pg_extensions/) for the complete list of extensions BigAnimal supports.

- See [Postgres extensions](/biganimal/release/using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/extensions) for more information on installing and working with extensions.

### EDB Postgres extensions
EDB develops and maintains several extensions. These include:

- [EDB Advanced Storage Pack](/pg_extensions/advanced_storage_pack/) &mdash; Provides advanced storage options for PostgreSQL databases in the form of table access method (TAM) extensions. These storage options can enhance the performance and reliability of databases without requiring application changes. 

  The TAM extensions included in the Advanced Storage Pack include:

  - [Autocluster](/pg_extensions/advanced_storage_pack/#autocluster) &mdash; Provides faster access to clustered data by keeping track of the last inserted row for any value in a side table. 

  - [Refdata](/pg_extensions/advanced_storage_pack/#refdata) &mdash; Can provide performance gains of 5-10% and increased scalability.
- [EDB Postgres Tuner](/pg_extensions/pg_tuner/) &mdash; Provides safe recommendations that maximize the use of available resources. 


## Foreign data wrappers

BigAnimal supports EDB's MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper and MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper. They allow you to connect your Postgres database server to external data sources. See:

- [MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper](/mongo_data_adapter/latest/) &mdash; Accesses data that resides on a MongoDB database from a Postgres database server.

- [MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper](/mysql_data_adapter/latest/) &mdash; Accesses data that resides on a MySQL database from a Postgres database server.

## Poolers

BigAnimal supports [EDB PgBouncer](/pgbouncer/latest/)and [EDB Pg-pool II](/pgpool/latest/) to manage your connections to your Postgres database. 


### EDB PgBouncer

EDB PgBouncer can manage your connections to Postgres databases and help your workloads run more efficiently. It is particularly useful if you plan to use more than a few hundred active connections. You can enable PgBouncer when creating your cluster (see [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#pgbouncer).) 

BigAnimal provisions up to three instances per PgBouncer-enabled cluster to ensure that performance is unaffected, so each availability zone receives its own instance of PgBouncer. 

If you want to customize your PgBouncer deployment, see the [How to configure PgBouncer with BigAnimal Cluster](https://support.biganimal.com/hc/en-us/articles/4848726654745-How-to-configure-PgBouncer-with-BigAnimal-Cluster) knowledgebase article.


### EDB Pgpool-II

EDB Pgpool-II acts as middleware between client applications and a Postgres database server. It saves connections to the Postgres servers, and reuses them whenever a new connection with the same properties (that is, username, database, protocol version) comes in. It reduces connection overhead, and improves the system's overall throughput.

See [EDB Pgpool-II](/pgpool/latest/) for information on installing and configuring EDB Pgpool-II.
