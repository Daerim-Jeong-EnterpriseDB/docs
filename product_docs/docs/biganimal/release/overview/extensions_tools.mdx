---

BigAnimal supports a number of Postgres extensions and tools, which you can install on your cluster.

## Postgres extensions

- See [Postgres extensions available by deployment](/pg_extensions/) for the complete list of extensions BigAnimal supports.

- See [Postgres extensions](/biganimal/release/using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/extensions) for more information on installing and working with extensions.

### EDB Postgres extensions
EDB develops and maintains several extensions. These include:

- [EDB Advanced Storage Pack](/pg_extensions/advanced_storage_pack/) &mdash; Provides advanced storage options for PostgreSQL databases in the form of table access method (TAM) extensions. These storage options can enhance the performance and reliability of databases without requiring application changes. 

  The TAM extensions included in the Advanced Storage Pack include:

  - [Autocluster](/pg_extensions/advanced_storage_pack/#autocluster) &mdash; Provides faster access to clustered data by keeping track of the last inserted row for any value in a side table. 

  - [Refdata](/pg_extensions/advanced_storage_pack/#refdata) &mdash; Can provide performance gains of 5-10% and increased scalability.
- [EDB Postgres Tuner](/pg_extensions/pg_tuner/) &mdash; Provides safe recommendations that maximize the use of available resources. 


## Foreign data wrappers

BigAnimal supports mongo_fdw and mysql_fdw foreign data wrapper extensions. They allow you to connect your Postgres database server to external data sources.

We also provide enhanced versions of the mongo_fdw and mysql_fdw extensions that are intended to support additional EDB Postgres Advanced Server capabilities. See:

- [MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper](/mongo_data_adapter/latest/) &mdash; Accesses data that resides on a MongoDB database from a Postgres database server.

- [MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper](/mysql_data_adapter/latest/) &mdash; Accesses data that resides on a MySQL database from a Postgres database server.

## Poolers

BigAnimal supports [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/community.html) and [Pgpool-II](https://www.pgpool.net/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) extensions to manage your connections to your Postgres database. 

We also provide enhanced versions of the extensions that are intended to support additional EDB Postgres Advanced Server capabilities. See:

- [EDB PgBouncer](/pgbouncer/latest/) &mdash; a lightweight connection pooling utility for Postgres installations

- [EDB Pgpool-II](/pgpool/latest/) &mdash; acts as middleware between client applications and a Postgres database server

### PgBouncer

PgBouncer can manage your connections to Postgres databases and help your workloads run more efficiently. This tool is particularly useful if you plan to use more than a few hundred active connections. 

You can deploy PgBouncer for use by your BigAnimal cluster either in your BigAnimal cluster or on a client. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#pgbouncer) for deploying PgBouncer on your BigAnimal cluster and [Configuring EDB PgBouncer for BigAnimal](../../using_cluster/02_connecting_your_cluster/pgbouncer_configuring) for information on deploying EDB PgBouncer on a client. 


### Pgpool-II

Pgpool-II acts as middleware between client applications and a Postgres database server. You can deploy Pgpool-II for use by your BigAnimal cluster on a client. See [EDB Pgpool-II](/pgpool/latest/).
