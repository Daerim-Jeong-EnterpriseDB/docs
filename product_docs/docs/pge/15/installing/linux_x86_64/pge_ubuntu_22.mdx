## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.
  To determine if your repository exists, enter this command: `apt-cache search enterprisedb`

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).
  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repo. Depending on your subscription level, you may be able to access two generations of EDB repos. EDB Repos 2.0 provides the most recent instructions.
  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

  Alternatively, you can set up the PostgreSQL community repository instead of the EDB repository. To set up the PostgreSQL community repository, go to [yum](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/) or [apt](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt).

## Install the package

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install edb-postgresextended-<xx> edb-postgresextended-<xx>-contrib
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Extended Server you are installing. For example, if you are installing version 15, the package name would be edb-postgresextended-15 edb-postgresextended-15-contrib.
