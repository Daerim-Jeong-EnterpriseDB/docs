## Preparing your upgrade

Ensure you review all upgrade information gathered in [Upgrading an installation with pg_upgrade](/epas/latest/upgrading/04_upgrading_an_installation_with_pg_upgrade/), before upgrading a production environment. It contains detailed information on all `pg_upgrade` options and considerations for environments using extensions. 

## Overview 

You can use `pg_upgrade` to upgrade an existing installation of EDB Postgres Extended Server into to a later version using the `initdb` command.

You must be an operating system superuser to perform an EDB Postgres Extended Server upgrade.

- [Prepare your upgrade](#preparing-your-upgrade) by performing a backup of the existing instance. 
- [Create a new database server](#creating-an-encrypted-server)
    - Create an empty directory for the new server and ensure `enterprisedb` owns it.
    - Initialize a server.
    - Change the default port, so the new server is available at another port. 
    - Start the database server.
    - Connect to the database server and ensure it is functioning.
- [Upgrade to the encrypted server](#upgrading-to-the-encrypted-server)
    - Stop both the source and the new server. 
    - Use `pg_upgrade` by specifying the source and target bin and data directories. 
    - Start the new database server. 
    - Connect to the encrypted database server and ensure the data was transfered. 
- [Clean up and delete the source server](#cleaning-up-after-upgrade)
    - Clean up the database and its statistics. 
    - Remove the source EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster with the script provided by `pg_upgrade`.
