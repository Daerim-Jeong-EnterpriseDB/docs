Performing a minor upgrade of your EDB Postgres Extended Server is very simple: update your packages and restart the server.

To update your packages, ensure you use the correct package manager for your operating system. 

- If you installed an RPM package of EDB Postgres Extended Server (on RHEL, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux) with `yum` or `dnf`, see [Minor EDB Postgres Extended Server upgrade of RPM packages](dnf_upgrade).

- If you installed a Debian package of EDB Postgres Extended Server (on Ubuntu, Debian) with `abt-get`, see [Minor EDB Postgres Extended Server upgrade of Debian packages ](apt_upgrade). 

When you upgrade the packages, the packager manager automatically installs the latest available minor version. For example, if you're running a xy.1 minor version, and the latest available minor version is xy.5, the package manager will automactically install xy.5, skipping xy.2 to xy.4.
