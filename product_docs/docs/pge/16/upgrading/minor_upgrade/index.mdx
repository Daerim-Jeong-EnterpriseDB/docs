Performing a minor upgrade of your EDB Postgres Extended Server is very simple: update your packages and restart the server.

To update your packages, ensure you use the correct package manager for your operating system. 

- If you installed EDB Postgres Extended Server (on RHEL, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux) with `yum` or `dnf`, you'll have to [update the package manager with `dnf`](dnf_upgrade).

- If you installed EDB Postgres Extended Server (on Ubuntu, Debian) with `abt-get`, you'll have to [update the package manager with `abt-get`](apt_upgrade). 

When you upgrade the packages, the packager manager automatically installs the latest available minor version. For example, if you run a xy.1 version, and the latest available minor version is xy.5 at the time you perform the upgrade, the package manager will automactically install xy.5, skipping xy.2 to xy.4.
