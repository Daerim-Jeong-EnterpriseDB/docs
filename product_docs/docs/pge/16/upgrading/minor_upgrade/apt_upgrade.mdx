## DEB installations

If you used a Debian package to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server or its supporting components, you can use `apt-get` to perform a minor version upgrade to a more recent version. To review a list of the package updates that are available for your system, open a command line, assume root privileges, and enter the command:

```shell
sudo abt-get check <package_name>
```
Where `package_name` is the search term for which you want to search for updates. You can include wildcard values in the search term.
For example, if you are looking for EDB Postgres Extended Packages, run: 

```shell
sudo abt-get check edb-pge*
```

Once you have figured the name and version of the package you want to install, use `dnf update` to install the package:

```shell
sudo abt-get update <package_name>
```

Where `package_name` is the name of the package you want to update. Include wildcard values in the update command to update multiple related packages with a single command. For example, use the following command to update all packages that include the expression `edb`:

```shell
sudo abt-get update edb-pge*
```

!!! Note
    The `abt-get` command performs an update only between minor releases. To update between major releases, use `pg_upgrade`.

For more information about using `abt-get` commands and options, enter `abt-get --help` at the command line.
