EDB Postgres Extended Server includes features to help you to maintain, secure, and operate EDB Postgres Extended Server databases.

You can configure GUC (grand unified configuration) parameters at runtime by modifying the `postgresql.conf` and `pg_hba.conf` files. 

- The `postgresql.conf` file allows you to make persistent changes to your database configuration. 
- The `pg_hba.conf` file allows you to change access and authentication settings. 

See [Setting Configuration Parameters](01_setting_configuration_parameters) for more information.
