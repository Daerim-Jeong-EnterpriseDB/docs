Setting up an EDB Transporter migration consists of a number of steps.

## Create in EDB Postgres AI a new database cluster

Create a new database cluster in the EDB Postgres AI. Also create a new database in the cluster.

## Planning: Ensure schema compatibility and migrate schema

Assess Oracle database sources for schema compatibility using the [EDB Migration Portal](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/) before starting the data migration process. Address incompatible schemas or exclude them from the migration and migrate the schema to the new database **without applying constrains**

## Preparing source database

Prepare the source database needed for the migration. To prepare, enable archive log mode and supplemental logging on the Oracle database and create a user. For details, see:

-  [Preparing Oracle source databases](preparing_db/preparing_oracle_source_databases/#preparing_oracle_sources)
-  [Preparing Postgres source databases](preparing_db/preparing_postgres_source_databases/#preparing_postgres_sources)

## Installing

Install EDB Transporter source reader. For details, see [Installing EDB Transporter software](installing).

## Configuring

Config and run EDB Transporter source reader. For details, see [Configuring EDB Transporter software](config_reader).

## Create a new Migration to Managed Postgres

Select the source and target databases for the migration. Also assign a name to the migration.

Select the tables and columns to migrate. Modify the table and column names if needed.

## Mark the migration as completed

The migrations consist in the following steps:
- Snapshot: Takes a snapshot of the source database
- CDC: Starts capturing changes from the source database

The CDC phase of the migration will not be completed until you mark the migration as completed. This is done by clicking the "Mark as completed" button in the EDB Portal.

## Apply constraints

When the migration is completed, apply constraints to the new database.

## Verify the migration

Verify that the migration was successful by comparing the source and target databases. To do it, you can use LiveCompare.

## Post-migration steps

After these steps, your migration is up and running. You can now stop and remove the customer-side software.
