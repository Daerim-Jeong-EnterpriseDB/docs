Setting up an EDB Transporter migration consists of a number of steps.

1.  Create a target database cluster in the EDB PostgresÂ® AI Console. 
1.  Prepare the schema with Migration Portal and migrate it to the target database. 
1.  Prepare your source Oracle or Postgres database. 
1.  Install EDB Transporter.
1.  Configure the EDB transporter source reader. 
1.  Create a new migration in the EDB Postgres AI Console. 

## Creating a database cluster in EDB Postgres AI

In the EDB Postgres AI Console, [create a database cluster](create_database.mdx).

## Migrating the schema to your database with Migration Portal

Use [EDB Migration Portal](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/) to assess Oracle database sources for schema compatibility before starting the data migration process. Address incompatible schemas or exclude them from the migration and migrate the schema to the new database **without applying constraints**.

## Preparing the source database

Prepare the source database for the migration:

-  Use `sqlplus` to [prepare the Oracle source database](preparing_db/preparing_oracle_source_databases/)
-  Use `psql` to [preparing the Postgres source database](preparing_db/preparing_postgres_source_databases/)

## Installing EDB Transporter 

Install the EDB Transporter source reader. For details, see [Installing EDB Transporter software](installing).

## Configuring the source reader

Configure the source reader to point at your source cloud provider and source database. Then, run the reader. 

For details, see [Configuring EDB Transporter software](config_reader).

## Creating a new Migration to Managed Postgres

In the EDB Postgres AI Console, [create a new migration](create_migration.mdx).

## Marking the migration as completed

The migrations consist in the following steps:
- Snapshot: Takes a snapshot of the source database
- CDC: Starts capturing changes from the source database

The CDC phase of the migration will not be completed until you mark the migration as completed. This is done by clicking the "Mark as completed" button in the EDB Portal.

## Apply constraints

When the migration is completed, apply constraints to the new database.

## Verify the migration

Verify that the migration was successful by comparing the source and target databases. To do it, you can use LiveCompare.

## Post-migration steps

After these steps, your migration is up and running. You can now stop and remove the customer-side software.
