title: "Preparing your schema"
---

Before you configure a Transporter migration, you must prepare your schema. Your schema's `table` objects and some `constraints` must be prepared before the Transporter migration takes place, whereas others must be applied [after the migration is completed](apply_constraints).

## Prerequisite 

You created a schema in the target database with the same name as the schema in the source database.

## Prepare your table objects

1.  Use any of EDB's supported [asessment and migration tools](#assessment-and-migration-tools) to ensure your `table` objects are compatible with Postgres. If there are incompatibilities, [Migration Portal](/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/03_mp_quick_start/) can help you convert them. 

1.  Connect to the target database and create `table` objects with the Postgres-compatible syntax.

## Prepare your constraints

### Primary Key and Unique constraints

Ensure you create **Primary Key** and **Unique** constraints in the target Postgres database before performing the Transporter migration. This ensures that the migration can validate and carry them over to the target database and doesn't present any errors.

1.  Use any of EDB's supported [asessment and migration tools](#assessment-and-migration-tools) to ensure your `constraints` are compatible with Postgres. If there are incompatibilities, [Migration Portal](/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/03_mp_quick_start/) can help you convert them.

1.  Connect to the target database and create ONLY **Public Key** and **Unique** constraints with the Postgres-compatible syntax. Other constraint types must be applied after you complete the migration with EDB Transporter.

### Other constraints 

Keep track of the constraints you excluded (all constraints that are not of the type **Primary Key**, or **Unique**) to ensure you [re-apply them](apply_constraints) after the migration is completed.

## Assessment and migration tools

These tools can help you convert query statements (DDL files) to Postgres. 

- You can use [EDB Migration Portal](/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/03_mp_quick_start/) to assess your schemas, convert incompatible statements, and generate export files with Postgres-compatible statements. Use the converted statements to create `tables` and `constraints`.

- You can use [EDB Migration Toolkit](/migration_toolkit/latest/07_invoking_mtk/) to generate export files that contain a list of compatible and converted statements. The export excludes incompatible statements. Use the converted statements to create `tables` and `constraints`.

- You can manually create and populate your schema with tables and constraints. Ensure the table and constraint statements are compatible with Postgres.
