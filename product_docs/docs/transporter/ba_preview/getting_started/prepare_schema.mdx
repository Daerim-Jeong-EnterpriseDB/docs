Use [EDB Migration Portal](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/) to assess Oracle database sources for schema compatibility before starting the data migration process. Address incompatible schemas or exclude them from the migration and migrate the schema to the new database **without applying constraints**.
