Use [EDB Migration Portal to assess Oracle database sources for schema compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/04_mp_migrating_database/02_mp_schema_assessment/#mp_schema_assessment) before starting the data migration process.

In the Migration Portal web application, [address incompatible DDL objects and schemas](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/03_mp_quick_start/) or exclude them from the migration and migrate the schema to the new database.

If you have [constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html) in place: 

## Primary Key and Unique constraints

If you have **Primary Key** and **Unique** constraints in your database, ensure you include these constraints when you migrate the schemas to the target Postgres database. Also ensure you create equivalent database tables and constraints. This ensures that the migration can validate and carry them over to the target database and doesn't present any errors.

## Other constraints 

For constraints that are _not_ of the type **Primary Key**, or **Unique**, ensure you exclude these constraints when you migrate the schemas to the target Postgres database. Keep track of the constraints you are excluding from the migration, so you can later easily [re-apply them](apply_constraints) after the migration is completed.
