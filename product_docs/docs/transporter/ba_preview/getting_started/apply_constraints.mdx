title: "Applying constraints"
---

Before starting the migration, you [prepared the schema](prepare_schema). Now, re-apply the constraints that were not included in the DDL import.

## Primary Key and Unique constraints

For **Primary Key** and **Unique** constraints, you have already created the tables and constraints in the target Postgres database, which means that the EDB Transporter has already mapped them and migrated data to the new instance. You don't need do to anything else. 

## Other constraints 

For constraints that are not of the type **Primary Key**, or **Unique**, you excluded them from the migration, which means you now have to manually re-apply them. Compare the target DDL objects with the source Oracle instance to ensure you don't forget to re-apply a constraint you excluded during the migration.
