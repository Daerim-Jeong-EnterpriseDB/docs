title: "Applying constraints"
---

Before starting the migration with EDB Transporter, you [prepared the schema](prepare_schema). Now, re-apply the constraints that were not included in migration.

## Primary Key and Unique constraints

For **Primary Key** and **Unique** constraints, you have already created the tables and constraints in the target Postgres database. This allowed EDB Transporter to map them to the source objects and migrated data sucessfuly. You don't need do to anything else. 

## Other constraints 

For constraints that are not of the type **Primary Key**, or **Unique**, you can now re-apply them. See [Asessment and migration tools](prepare_schema/#assessment-and-migration-tools) for an overview of tools you can use to ensure the constraint syntax is compatible with Postgres, or to help you convert it.
