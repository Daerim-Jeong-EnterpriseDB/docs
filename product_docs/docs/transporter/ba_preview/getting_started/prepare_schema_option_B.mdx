title: "Preparing your schema option B"
---

Before you configure a Transporter migration, you must import your schema to the target database. Some `constraints` must be excluded from the schema import before the Transporter migration takes place, whereas others must be applied [after the migration is completed](apply_constraints).

## Prerequisite 

You created a schema in the target database with the same name as the schema in the source database.

## Prepare your schema

1.  Use any of EDB's supported [asessment and migration tools](#assessment-and-migration-tools) to ensure your objects are compatible with Postgres. If there are incompatibilities, [Migration Portal](/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/03_mp_quick_start/) can help you convert them. 

1.  Before migrating the schema, remove all `constraint` statements except the **Private Key** and **Unique** constraints. The reader supports migrating **Private Key** and **Unique** constraints, but it cannot recognize constraints of other types.

    !!!note 
       Exclude all constraints that are not of the type **Primary Key**, or **Unique** from the schema import. Keep track of the constraints you excluded to ensure you [re-apply them](apply_constraints) after the migration is completed.
    !!!

1.  Connect to the target database and create the schema objects with the Postgres-compatible DDL file.

## Assessment and migration tools

These tools can help you convert query statements (DDL files) to Postgres. 

- You can use [EDB Migration Portal](/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/03_mp_quick_start/) to assess your schemas, convert incompatible statements, and generate export files with Postgres-compatible statements. Use the converted statements to create `tables` and `constraints`.

- You can use [EDB Migration Toolkit](/migration_toolkit/latest/07_invoking_mtk/) to generate export files that contain a list of compatible and converted statements. The export excludes incompatible statements. Use the converted statements to create `tables` and `constraints`.

- You can manually create and populate your schema with tables and constraints. Ensure the table and constraint statements are compatible with Postgres.
