## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Log in as a superuser:

  ```shell
  sudo su -
  ```

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the screen instructions.

  Instructions for installing the package are also available from the repository. If you need additional information about running the install command or initial configuration, refer back to this topic.

## Install the package

```shell
# To install PostGIS 3.2 using EDB Postgres Advanced Server 13-14:
apt-get install edb-as<xx>-postgis32

# To install PostGIS 3.2 using EDB Postgres Advanced Server 12:
apt-get install edb-as<xx>-postgis-3.2

# To install PostGIS 3.1 using EDB Postgres Advanced Server 13-14:
apt-get install edb-as<xx>-postgis3

# To install PostGIS 3.1 using EDB Postgres Advanced Server 12:
apt-get install edb-as12-postgis-3.1
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Replace `<xx>` with the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server you are using. For example, `edb-as14-postgis32`.
