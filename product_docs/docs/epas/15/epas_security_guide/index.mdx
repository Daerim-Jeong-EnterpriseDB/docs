EPAS extends Postgres security with security features designed to limit unauthorized access. The topics in this section describe how to use these features:

-   **[Protecting against SQL injection attacks](02_protecting_against_sql_injection_attacks/#protecting_against_sql_injection_attacks)**&#8212With the SQL/Protect feature, EPAS offers protection against SQL injection attacks by examining incoming queries for common SQL injection profiles.  SQL/Protect also allows you to monitor queries based on protected roles, and provides comprehensive statistics and records of attack attempts, including origin IPs and ports as well as full details of the queries attempted.            
-   **[Implementing Virtual Private Database](03_virtual_private_database/#virtual_private_database)**&#8212Virtual Private Database offers fine-grained access control to data down to specific rows, as defined by the security policy. The security policy consists of a policy function, which can be written in SQL, PL/pgSQL or any other language supported by EPAS, and an association of this function with a specific database object, typically a table. 
-   **[Generating SSL certificates](04_sslutils/#sslutils)**&#8212The sslutils Postgres extension provides SSL certificate generation functions to EPAS for use by the EDB Postgres Enterprise Manager server. The sslutils package generates openssl RSA keys, certificate signing requests, as well as certificate authority certificates.
-   **[Redacting data](05_data_redaction/#data_redaction)**&#8212Use the EPAS Data redaction feature to limit exposure to sensitive data by dynamically changing the data as it is displayed for certain users. This feature works by defining column-level security policies for tables that call specific redaction function expressions. These policies can be further controlled with scope and exception options.

## Transparent data encryption

In addition, EPAS offers [Transparent data encryption](/tde/latest) feature, which encrypts any user data stored in the database system. This encryption is transparent to the user. User data includes the actual data stored in tables and other objects as well as system catalog data such as the names of objects.
