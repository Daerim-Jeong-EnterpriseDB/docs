<div id="building_the_edb_loader_control_file" class="registered_link"></div>

When you invoke EDB\*Loader, the list of arguments provided must include the name of a control file. The control file includes the instructions that EDB\*Loader uses to load the tables from the input data file. The control file includes information such as:

-   The name of the input data file containing the data to load
-   The name of the tables to load from the data file
-   Names of the columns in the tables and their corresponding field placement in the data file
-   Specification of whether the data file uses a delimiter string to separate the fields or if the fields occupy fixed column positions
-   Optional selection criteria to choose the records from the data file to load into a given table
-   The name of the file that collects illegally formatted records
-   The name of the discard file that collects records that don't meet the selection criteria of any table

## Control file syntax

The syntax for the EDB\*Loader control file is:

```sql
[ OPTIONS (<param=value> [, <param=value> ] ...) ]
LOAD DATA
  [ CHARACTERSET <charset> ]
  [ INFILE '{ <data_file> | <stdin> }' ]
  [ BADFILE '<bad_file>' ]
  [ DISCARDFILE '<discard_file>' ]
  [ { DISCARDMAX | DISCARDS } <max_discard_recs> ]
[ INSERT | APPEND | REPLACE | TRUNCATE ]
[ PRESERVE BLANKS ]
{ INTO TABLE <target_table>
  [ WHEN <field_condition> [ AND <field_condition> ] ...]
  [ FIELDS TERMINATED BY '<termstring>'
    [ OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '<enclstring>' ] ]
  [ RECORDS DELIMITED BY '<delimstring>' ]
  [ TRAILING NULLCOLS ]
   (<field_def> [, <field_def> ] ...)
} ...
```

Where `field_def` defines a field in the specified `data_file`. The field describes the location, data format, or value of the data to insert into `column_name` of `target_table`. The syntax of `field_def` is:

```sql
<column_name> {
  CONSTANT <val> |
  FILLER [ POSITION (<start:end>) ] [ <fieldtype> ] |
  BOUNDFILLER [ POSITION (<start:end>) ] [ <fieldtype> ] |
  [ POSITION (<start:end>) ] [ <fieldtype> ]
  [ NULLIF <field_condition> [ AND <field_condition> ] ...]
  [ PRESERVE BLANKS ] [ "<expr>" ]
}
```

Where `fieldtype` is one of:

```sql
CHAR [(<length>)] | DATE [(<length>)] | TIMESTAMP [(<length>)] [ "<datemask>" ] | 
INTEGER EXTERNAL [(<length>)] |
FLOAT EXTERNAL [(<length>)] | DECIMAL EXTERNAL [(<length>)] |
ZONED EXTERNAL [(<length>)] | ZONED [(<precision> [,<scale>])]
```

## Description

The specification of `data_file`, `bad_file`, and `discard_file` can include the full directory path or a relative directory path to the file name. If the file name is specified alone or with a relative directory path, the file is then assumed to exist, in the case of `data_file`, relative to the current working directory from which you invoke `edbldr. In the case of `bad_file` or `discard_file`, it's created.

You can include references to environment variables in the EDB\*Loader control file when referring to a directory path or file name. Environment variable references are formatted differently on Windows systems than on Linux systems:

-   On Linux, the format is `$ENV_VARIABLE` or `${ENV_VARIABLE}`.
-   On Windows, the format is `%ENV_VARIABLE%`.

Where `ENV_VARIABLE` is the environment variable that's set to the directory path or file name.

Set the `EDBLDR_ENV_STYLE` environment variable to interpret environment variable references as Windows-styled references or Linux-styled references regardless of the operating system on which EDB\*Loader resides. You can use this environment variable to create portable control files for EDB\*Loader.

-   On a Windows system, set `EDBLDR_ENV_STYLE` to `linux` or `unix` to recognize Linux-style references in the control file.
-   On a Linux system, set `EDBLDR_ENV_STYLE` to `windows` to recognize Windows-style references in the control file.

The operating system account `enterprisedb` must have read permission on the directory and file specified by `data_file`.

The operating system account enterprisedb must have write permission on the directories where `bad_file` and `discard_file` are written.

!!! Note
    The file names for `data_file`, `bad_file`, and `discard_file` must have extensions `.dat`, `.bad`, and `.dsc`, respectively. If the provided file name doesn't have an extension, EDB\*Loader assumes the actual file name includes the appropriate extension.

Suppose an EDB\*Loader session results in data format errors, the `BADFILE` clause isn't specified, and the BAD parameter isn't given on the command line when `edbldr` is invoked. In this case, a bad file is created with the name `control_file_base.bad` in the directory from which `edbldr` is invoked. `control_file_base` is the base name of the control file used in the `edbldr` session.

If all of the following conditions are true, the discard file isn't created even if the EDB\*Loader session results in discarded records:

-   The `DISCARDFILE` clause for specifying the discard file isn't included in the control file.
-   The `DISCARD` parameter for specifying the discard file isn't included on the command line.
-   The `DISCARDMAX` clause for specifying the maximum number of discarded records isn't included in the control file.
-   The `DISCARDS` clause for specifying the maximum number of discarded records isn't included in the control file.
-   The `DISCARDMAX` parameter for specifying the maximum number of discarded records isn't included on the command line.

Suppose you don't specify the `DISCARDFILE` clause and the `DISCARD` parameter for explicitly specifying the discard file name, but you do specify `DISCARDMAX` or `DISCARDS`. In this case, the EDB\*Loader session creates a discard file using the data file name with an extension of `.dsc`.

!!! Note
    The keywords `DISCARD` and `DISCARDS` differ. `DISCARD` is an EDB\*Loader command line parameter used to specify the discard file name (see [General usage](#general-usage)). `DISCARDS` is a clause of the `LOAD DATA` directive that can appear only in the control file. Keywords `DISCARDS` and `DISCARDMAX` provide the same functionality of specifying the maximum number of discarded records allowed before terminating the EDB\*Loader session. Records loaded into the database before terminating the EDB\*Loader session due to exceeding the `DISCARDS` or `DISCARDMAX` settings are kept in the database. They aren't rolled back.

Specifying one of `INSERT`, `APPEND`, `REPLACE`, or `TRUNCATE` establishes the default action for adding rows to target tables. The default action is `INSERT`.

If you specify the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` clause, then you can't specify the `POSITION (start:end)` clause for any `field_def`. Alternatively, if you don't specify the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` clause, then every `field_def` must contain the `POSITION (start:end)` clause, the `fieldtype(length)` clause, or the `CONSTANT` clause.

## Parameters

`OPTIONS param=value`

 Use the `OPTIONS` clause to specify `param=value` pairs that represent an EDB\*Loader directive. If you specify a parameter in the `OPTIONS` clause and on the command line when `edbldr` is invoked, the command line setting takes effect.

 Specify one or more of the following parameter/value pairs:

-   `DIRECT= { FALSE | TRUE }`

    With `DIRECT` set to `TRUE`, EDB\*Loader performs a direct path load instead of a conventional path load. The default value of `DIRECT` is `FALSE`.

    Don't set `DIRECT=true` when loading the data into a replicated table. If you're using EDB\*Loader to load data into a replicated table and set `DIRECT=true`, indexes might omit rows that are in a table or can potentially contain references to rows that were deleted. Direct inserts to load data into replicated tables aren't supported.

    For information on direct path loads see, [Direct path load](#direct-path-load).

-   `ERRORS=error_count`

    `error_count` specifies the number of errors permitted before aborting the EDB\*Loader session. The default is `50`.

-   `FREEZE= { FALSE | TRUE }`

    Set `FREEZE` to `TRUE` to copy the data with the rows `frozen`. A tuple guaranteed to be visible to all current and future transactions is marked as frozen to prevent transaction ID wraparound. For more information about frozen tuples, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/routine-vacuuming.html).

    You must specify a data-loading type of `TRUNCATE` in the control file when using the `FREEZE` option. `FREEZE` isn't supported for direct loading.

    By default, `FREEZE` is `FALSE`.

-   `PARALLEL= { FALSE | TRUE }`

    Set `PARALLEL` to `TRUE` to indicate that this EDB\*Loader session is one of a number of concurrent EDB\*Loader sessions participating in a parallel direct path load. The default value of `PARALLEL` is `FALSE`.

    When `PARALLEL` is `TRUE`, you must also set the `DIRECT` parameter to `TRUE`. For more information about parallel direct path loads, see [Parallel direct path load](#parallel-direct-path-load).

-   `ROWS=n`

    `n` specifies the number of rows that EDB\*Loader commits before loading the next set of `n` rows.

    If EDB\*Loader encounters an invalid row during a load in which the `ROWS` parameter is specified, those rows committed prior to encountering the error remain in the destination table.

-   `SKIP=skip_count`

    `skip_count` specifies the number of records at the beginning of the input data file to skip before loading begins. The default is `0`.

-   `SKIP_INDEX_MAINTENANCE={ FALSE | TRUE }`

    If `SKIP_INDEX_MAINTENANCE` is `TRUE`, index maintenance isn't performed as part of a direct path load, and indexes on the loaded table are marked as invalid. The default value of `SKIP_INDEX_MAINTENANCE` is `FALSE`.

    !!! Note
        During a parallel direct path load, target table indexes aren't updated. They are marked as invalid after the load is complete.

    You can use the `REINDEX` command to rebuild an index. For more information about the `REINDEX` command, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-reindex.html).

`charset`

 Use the `CHARACTERSET` clause to identify the character set encoding of `data_file`, where `charset` is the character set name. This clause is required if the data file encoding differs from the control file encoding. The control file encoding must always be in the encoding of the client where `edbldr` is invoked.

 Examples of `charset` settings are `UTF8`, `SQL_ASCII`, and `SJIS`.

 For more information about client-to-database character-set conversion, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/multibyte.html).

`data_file`

 File containing the data to load into `target_table`. Each record in the data file corresponds to a row to insert into `target_table`.

 If you don't include an extension in the file name, EDB\*Loader assumes the file has an extension of `.dat`, for example, `mydatafile.dat`.

 !!! Note
    If you specify the `DATA` parameter on the command line when invoking `edbldr`, the file given by the command line `DATA` parameter is used instead.

 If you omit the `INFILE` clause and the command line `DATA` parameter, then the data file name is assumed to be the same as the control file name but with the extension `.dat`.

`stdin`

 Specify `stdin` (all lowercase letters) if you want to use standard input to pipe the data to load directly to EDB\*Loader. This technique is useful for data sources generating a large number of records to load.

`bad_file`

 A file that receives `data_file` records that can't load due to errors. The bad file is generated for collecting rejected or bad records.

 For EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 12 and later, a bad file is generated only if there are any bad or rejected records. However, if an existing bad file has the same name and location, and no bad records are generated after invoking a new version of `edbldr`, the existing bad file remains intact.

 If you don't include an extension in the file name, EDB\*Loader assumes the file has an extension of `.bad`, for example, `mybadfile.bad`.

 !!! Note
    If you specify the `BAD` parameter on the command line when invoking `edbldr`, the file given with the command line `BAD` parameter is used instead.

`discard_file`

 File that receives input data records that aren't loaded into any table. This input data records are discarded because none of the selection criteria are met for tables with the `WHEN` clause and there are no tables without a `WHEN` clause. All records meet the selection criteria of a table without a `WHEN` clause.

 If you don't include an extension with the file name, EDB\*Loader assumes the file has an extension of `.dsc`, for example, `mydiscardfile.dsc`.

 !!! Note
    If you specify the `DISCARD` parameter on the command line when invoking `edbldr`, the file given with the command line `DISCARD` parameter is used instead.

`{ DISCARDMAX | DISCARDS } max_discard_recs`

 Maximum number of discarded records that the input data records can encounter before terminating the EDB\*Loader session. You can use either keyword `DISCARDMAX` or `DISCARDS` preceding the integer value specified by `max_discard_recs`.

 For example, if `max_discard_recs` is `0`, then the EDB\*Loader session is terminated when a first discarded record is encountered. If `max_discard_recs` is `1`, then the EDB\*Loader session is terminated when a second discarded record is encountered.

 When the EDB\*Loader session is terminated due to exceeding `max_discard_recs`, prior input data records that were loaded into the database are retained. They aren't rolled back.

`INSERT | APPEND | REPLACE | TRUNCATE`

 Specifies how to load data into the target tables. Specifying one of `INSERT`, `APPEND`, `REPLACE`, or `TRUNCATE` establishes the default action for all tables, overriding the default of `INSERT`.

-   `INSERT`

    Data is loaded into an empty table. EDB\*Loader throws an exception and doesn't load any data if the table isn't initially empty.

    !!! Note
        If the table contains rows, you must use the `TRUNCATE` command to empty the table before invoking EDB\*Loader. EDB\*Loader throws an exception if you use the `DELETE` command to empty the table instead of the `TRUNCATE` command. Oracle SQL\*Loader allows you to empty the table by using either the `DELETE` or `TRUNCATE` command.

-   `APPEND`

    Data is added to any existing rows in the table. The table also can be empty initially.

-   `REPLACE`

    The `REPLACE` keyword and `TRUNCATE` keywords are functionally identical. The table is truncated by EDB\*Loader before loading the new data.

    !!! Note
        Delete triggers on the table aren't fired as a result of the `REPLACE` operation.

-   `TRUNCATE`

    The table is truncated by EDB\*Loader before loading the new data. Delete triggers on the table aren't fired as a result of the `TRUNCATE` operation.

`PRESERVE BLANKS`

 The `PRESERVE BLANKS` option works only with the `OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY` clause. It retains leading and trailing whitespaces for both delimited and predetermined size fields. 
 
 In case of `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`, if the fields are delimited, then only leading whitespaces are omitted. If any trailing whitespaces are present, they are left intact. In the case of predetermined-sized fields with `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`, the trailing whitespaces are omitted. Any leading whitespaces are left intact. 

 !!! Note
    If you don't explicitly provide `PRESERVE BLANKS` or `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`, then the behavior defaults to `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`. This option doesn't work for ideographic whitespaces. 
 
`target_table`

 Name of the table into which to load data. The table name can be schema-qualified (for example, `enterprisedb.emp`). The specified target can't be a view.

`field_condition`

 Conditional clause taking the following form:

```text
[ ( ] { (start:end) | column_name } { = | != | <> } 'val' [ ) ]
```

 This conditional clause is used for the `WHEN` clause, which is part of the `INTO TABLE target_table` clause. It's also used for the `NULLIF` clause, which is part of the field definition denoted as `field_def` in the syntax diagram.

 `start` and `end` are positive integers specifying the column positions in `data_file` that mark the beginning and end of a field to compare with the constant `val`. The first character in each record begins with a `start` value of `1`.

 `column_name` specifies the name assigned to a field definition of the data file as defined by `field_def` in the syntax diagram.

 Using (`start`:`end`) or `column_name` defines the portion of the record in `data_file` to compare with the value specified by `val` to evaluate as either true or false.

 All characters used in the `field_condition` text (particularly in the `val` string) must be valid in the database encoding. For performing data conversion, EDB\*Loader first converts the characters in `val` string to the database encoding and then to the data file encoding.

 In the `WHEN field_condition [ AND field_condition ]` clause, if all such conditions evaluate to `TRUE` for a given record, then EDB\*Loader attempts to insert that record into `target_table`. If the insert operation fails, the record is written to `bad_file`.

 Suppose, for a given record, that none of the `WHEN` clauses evaluate to `TRUE` for all `INTO TABLE` clauses. The record is written to `discard_file` if a discard file was specified for the EDB\*Loader session.

 See the description of the `NULLIF` clause in this parameters list for the effect of `field_condition` on this clause.

`termstring`

 String of one or more characters that separates each field in `data_file`. The characters can be single byte or multibyte. However, they must be valid in the database encoding. Two consecutive appearances of `termstring` with no intervening character results in the corresponding column being set to null.

`enclstring`

 String of one or more characters used to enclose a field value in `data_file`. The characters can be single byte or multibyte, However, they must be valid in the database encoding. Use `enclstring` on fields where `termstring` appears as part of the data.

`delimstring`

 String of one or more characters that separates each record in `data_file`. The characters can be single byte or multibyte. However, they must be valid in the database encoding. Two consecutive appearances of `delimstring` with no intervening character results in no corresponding row being loaded into the table. You must also terminate the last record (that is, the end of the data file) with the `delimstring` characters. Otherwise, the final record isn't loaded into the table.

 !!! Note
    The `RECORDS DELIMITED BY 'delimstring'` clause isn't compatible with Oracle databases.

`TRAILING NULLCOLS`

 If you specify `TRAILING NULLCOLS`, then the columns in the column list for which there's no data in `data_file` for a given record are set to null when the row is inserted. This option applies only to one or more consecutive columns at the end of the column list.

 If fields are omitted at the end of a record and you don't specify `TRAILING NULLCOLS`, EDB\*Loader assumes the record contains formatting errors and writes it to the bad file.

`column_name`

 Name of a column in `target_table` into which to insert a field value defined by `field_def`. If the field definition includes the `FILLER` or `BOUNDFILLER` clause, then `column_name` isn't required as the name of a column in the table. It can be any identifier name since the `FILLER` and `BOUNDFILLER` clauses prevent loading the field data into a table column.

`CONSTANT val`

 Specifies a constant that's type-compatible with the column data type to which it's assigned in a field definition. You can use single or double quotes around `val`. If `val` contains white space, then you must use quotation marks around it.

 The use of the `CONSTANT` clause determines the value to assign to a column in each inserted row. No other clause can appear in the same field definition.

 If you use the `TERMINATED BY` clause to delimit the fields in `data_file`, there must be no delimited field in `data_file` corresponding to any field definition with a `CONSTANT` clause. In other words, EDB\*Loader assumes there's no field in `data_file` for any field definition with a `CONSTANT` clause.

`FILLER`

 Specifies not to load the data in the field defined by the field definition into the associated column if the identifier of the field definition is an actual column name in the table. In this case, the column is set to null. Use of the `FILLER` or `BOUNDFILLER` clause is the only circumstance in which you don't have to identify the field definition with an actual column name.

 Unlike the `BOUNDFILLER` clause, you can't reference an identifier defined with the `FILLER` clause in a SQL expression. See the discussion of the `expr` parameter.

`BOUNDFILLER`

 Specifies not to load the data in the field defined by the field definition into the associated column if the identifier of the field definition is an actual column name in the table. In this case, the column is set to null. Use of the `FILLER` or `BOUNDFILLER` clause is the only circumstance in which you don't have to identify the field definition with an actual column name.

 Unlike the `FILLER` clause, a SQL expression can reference an identifier defined with the `BOUNDFILLER` clause. See the discussion of the `expr` parameter.

`POSITION (start:end)`

 Defines the location of the field in a record in a fixed-width field data file. `start` and `end` are positive integers. The first character in the record has a start value of `1`.

```sql
CHAR [(<length>)] | DATE [(<length>)] | TIMESTAMP [(<length>)] [ "<datemask>" ] | 
INTEGER EXTERNAL [(<length>)] |
FLOAT EXTERNAL [(<length>)] | DECIMAL EXTERNAL [(<length>)] |
ZONED EXTERNAL [(<length>)] | ZONED [(<precision>[,<scale>])]
```

 Field type that describes the format of the data field in `data_file`.

 !!! Note 
    Specifying a field type is optional for descriptive purposes and has no effect on whether EDB\*Loader successfully inserts the data in the field into the table column. Successful loading depends on the compatibility of the column data type and the field value. For example, a column with data type `NUMBER(7,2)` successfully accepts a field containing `2600`. However, if the field contains a value such as `26XX`, the insertion fails, and the record is written to `bad_file`.

`ZONED` data is not human readable. `ZONED` data is stored in an internal format where each digit is encoded in a separate nibble/nybble/4-bit field. In each `ZONED` value, the last byte contains a single digit in the high-order 4 bits and the sign in the low-order 4 bits.

`length`

 Specifies the length of the value to load into the associated column.

 If you specify the `POSITION` (`start`:`end`) clause with a `fieldtype(length)` clause, then the ending position of the field is overridden by the specified `length` value. That is, the length of the value to load into the column is determined by the `length` value beginning at the `start` position and not by the `end` position of the `POSITION` (`start`:`end`) clause. Thus, the value to load into the column might be shorter than the field defined by `POSITION` (`start`:`end`). Or, it might go beyond the end position, depending on the specified `length` size.

 If you specify the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY 'termstring'` clause as part of the `INTO TABLE` clause, and a field definition contains the `fieldtype(length)` clause, then a record is accepted. However, the specified `length` values must be greater than or equal to the field lengths as determined by the `termstring` characters enclosing all such fields of the record. If the specified `length` value is less than a field length as determined by the enclosing `termstring` characters for any such field, then the record is rejected.

 If you don't specify the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY 'termstring'` clause, and you don't include the `POSITION` (`start`:`end`) clause with a field containing the `fieldtype(length)` clause, then the starting position of this field begins with the next character following the ending position of the preceding field. The ending position of the preceding field is either:

 -  The end of its `length` value if the preceding field contains the `fieldtype(length)` clause
 -  Its `end` parameter if the field contains the `POSITION` (`start`:`end`) clause without the `fieldtype(length)` clause

`precision`

 Use `precision` to specify the length of the `ZONED` value.

 If the `precision` value specified for `ZONED` conflicts with the length calculated by the server based on information provided with the `POSITION` clause, EDB\*Loader uses the value specified for `precision`.

`scale`

 Specifies the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in a `ZONED` value.

`datemask`

 Specifies the ordering and abbreviation of the day, month, and year components of a date field.

 !!! Note
    If you specify the `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP` field type with a SQL expression for the column, then you must specify `datemask` after `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP` and before the SQL expression. See the discussion of the `expr` parameter.

 When using the `TIMESTAMP` field datatype, if you specify `time_stamp timestamp "yyyymmddhh24miss"`, the `datemask` is converted to the SQL expression. However, in the case of `time_stamp timestamp "select to_timestamp(:time_stamp, 'yyyymmddhh24miss')"`, EDB\*Loader can't differentiate between datemask and the SQL expression. It treats the third field (SQL expression in the example) as datemask and prepares the SQL expression, which isn't valid. Where:
 
-   `first field` specifies the column name. 
-   `second field` specifies the datatype.
-   `third field` specifies the datemask.

If you want to provide an SQL expression, then a workaround is to specify the datemask and SQL expression using the `TO_CHAR` function as:
 
 ```sql
 time_stamp timestamp "yyyymmddhh24miss" "to_char(to_timestamp(:time_stamp, 'yyyymmddhh24miss'), 'yyyymmddhh24miss')"
 ```

`NULLIF field_condition [ AND field_condition ] ...`

 See the description of `field_condition` in this parameter list for the syntax of `field_condition`.

 If all field conditions evaluate to `TRUE`, then the column identified by `column_name` in the field definition is set to null. If any field condition evaluates to `FALSE`, then the column is set to the appropriate value as normally occurs according to the field definition.

`PRESERVE BLANKS`

 The `PRESERVE BLANKS` option works only with the `OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY` clause and retains leading and trailing whitespaces for both delimited and predetermined size fields. 
 
 In case of `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`, if the fields are delimited, then only leading whitespaces are omitted. If any trailing whitespaces are present, they are left intact. In the case of predetermined-sized fields with `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`, the trailing whitespaces are omitted, and any leading whitespaces are left intact. 

 !!! Note
    If you don't provide `PRESERVE BLANKS` or `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`, then the behavior defaults to `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`. This option doesn't work for ideographic whitespaces. 
 
`expr`

 A SQL expression returning a scalar value that's type-compatible with the column data type to which it's assigned in a field definition. Use double quotes around `expr`. `expr` can contain a reference to any column in the field list except for fields with the `FILLER` clause. Prefix the column name using a colon (`:`).

 `expr` can also consist of a SQL `SELECT` statement. If you use a `SELECT` statement:

-   Enclose the `SELECT` statement in parentheses, that is, `(SELECT ...)`.
-   The select list must consist of one expression following the `SELECT` keyword.
-   The result set must not return more than one row. If no rows are returned, then the returned value of the resulting expression is null.

    The following is the syntax for a `SELECT` statement:

    ```sql
    "(SELECT <expr> [ FROM <table_list> [ WHERE <condition> ] ])"
    ```

    !!! Note
        Omitting the `FROM table_list` clause isn't compatible with Oracle databases. If you don't need to specify any tables, using the `FROM DUAL` clause is compatible with Oracle databases.
