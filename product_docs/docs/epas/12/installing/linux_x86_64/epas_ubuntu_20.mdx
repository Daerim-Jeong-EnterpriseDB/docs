## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

## Install the package

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install edb-as<xx>-server
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of the EDB Postgres Advanced server you are installing. For example, if you are installing version 12, the package name would be `edb-as12-server`.

To install an individual component:

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install <package_name>
```

Where `package_name` can be any of the available packages from the [available package list](/epas/12/installing/linux_install_details/rpm_packages/).

## Initial configuration

This section steps you through getting started with your cluster including logging in, ensuring the installation was successful, connecting to your cluster, and creating the user password.

To work in your cluster, login as the enterprisedb user. Connect to the database server using the psql command line client.

```shell
sudo su - enterprisedb

psql edb
```

The server runs with the `peer` or `ident` permission by default. You can change the authentication method by modifying the `pg_hba.conf` file.

Before changing the authentication method, assign a password to the database superuser, enterprisedb. For more information on changing the authentication, see [modifying the pg_hba.conf file](/epas/latest/epas_guide/03_database_administration/01_configuration_parameters/01_setting_new_parameters/#modifying-the-pg_hbaconf-file).

```sql
ALTER ROLE enterprisedb IDENTIFIED BY password;
```

## Experiment

Now you are ready to create and connect to a database, create a table, insert data in a table, and view the data from the table.

This example shows the commands you run. The following example includes the output youâ€™ll see.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE hr;

\c hr

CREATE TABLE public.dept (deptno numeric(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk
PRIMARY KEY, dname varchar(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE, loc
varchar(13));

INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','NEW YORK');
INSERT into dept VALUES (20,'RESEARCH','DALLAS');

SELECT * FROM dept;
```

This example includes the output of the commands so you can cross-check the output when you run the commands. Don't copy commands from this example as it includes the output and would result in errors.

```text
edb=# CREATE DATABASE hr;
CREATE DATABASE
edb=#
edb=# \c hr
psql (15.2.0, server 15.2.0)
You are now connected to database "hr" as user "enterprisedb".
hr=#
hr=# CREATE TABLE public.dept (deptno numeric(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk
hr(# PRIMARY KEY, dname varchar(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE, loc
hr(# varchar(13));
CREATE TABLE
hr=#
hr=# INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','NEW YORK');
INSERT 0 1
hr=# INSERT into dept VALUES (20,'RESEARCH','DALLAS');
INSERT 0 1
hr=#
hr=# SELECT * FROM dept;
deptno  |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
10      | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
20      | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
(2 rows)
```
