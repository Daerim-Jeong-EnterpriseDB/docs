| Security |edbldr: check pg_read_server_files privilege before data file access. (#35906)
Permission to read data from the server File System should be restricted to superusers or users who possess the pg_read_server_files role. However, in affected versions of EPAS, any user can use edbldr to read data from any server file which is accessible to the OS user account under which EPAS is running. With this fix, a non-superuser using edbldr must either possess the pg_read_server_files role or must load data from standard input, rather than the server filesystem. Customer Advisory: CVE-2024-4545-for-db-2681 |
| Bug&nbsp;fix    | 	
Fix assertion in DROP ROLE statement having duplicate names. | Bug      |
| Security fix   | Fixed a security vulnerability that could  allow users using edbldr to bypass role permissions from pg_read_server_files. This could allow low privilege users to read files to which they would not otherwise have access. This issue is tracked as [CVE-2024-4545](linktoadvisory). | Security |
