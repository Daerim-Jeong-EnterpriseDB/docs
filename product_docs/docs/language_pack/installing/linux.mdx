## Installing with EPAS

Installing EPAS on any Linux platform also installs language packs for Perl, Python, and CTL. See the [installation documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/installing/) for more information on accessing the EDB repository and installing EPAS.  

## Installing with PostgreSQL

When using PostgreSQL language packs are optional. By default they are not required, but they are necessary for some built options. For more information see [PostgreSQL requirements](https://tinyurl.com/45f4r9h4)
